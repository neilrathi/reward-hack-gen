<user>: user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Two of Farmer John's cows, Bessie and Elsie, are planning to race on $$$n$$$ islands. There are $$$n - 1$$$ main bridges, connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$i + 1$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n - 1$$$. Additionally, there are $$$m$$$ alternative bridges. Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.

Initially, Elsie starts on island $$$1$$$, and Bessie starts on island $$$s$$$. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island $$$i$$$. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$j$$$, then the cow can move to island $$$j$$$. Then, island $$$i$$$ collapses, and all bridges connecting to island $$$i$$$ also collapse. Also, note the following:

- If there are no bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to another island, then island $$$i$$$ collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.
- If the other cow is also on island $$$i$$$, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.
- After an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.
- If a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.

The race ends once either cow reaches island $$$n$$$. It can be shown that regardless of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island $$$n$$$. Bessie wins if and only if she reaches island $$$n$$$ first.

For each $$$1 \leq s \leq n - 1$$$, determine whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island $$$s$$$. Assume both cows follow optimal strategies to ensure their own respective victories.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) – the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) – the number of islands and the number of alternative bridges.

The next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case contain $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u < v \leq n$$$) – the islands that the alternative bridge connects. It is guaranteed all alternative bridges are distinct, and they do not coincide with the main bridges.

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of $$$n$$$ nor the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases exceeds $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a binary string of length $$$n - 1$$$ on a new line. The $$$i$$$'th character is $$$1$$$ if it is possible for Bessie to win if she starts on island $$$i$$$. Otherwise, it is $$$0$$$.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ with $$$n$$$ nodes and values $$$l_i, r_i$$$ for each node. You can choose an initial value $$$a_i$$$ satisfying $$$l_i\le a_i\le r_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th node. A tree is balanced if all node values are equal, and the value of a balanced tree is defined as the value of any node.

In one operation, you can choose two nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and increase the values of all nodes in the subtree$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of node $$$v$$$ by $$$1$$$ while considering $$$u$$$ as the root of the entire tree. Note that $$$u$$$ may be equal to $$$v$$$.

Your goal is to perform a series of operations so that the tree becomes balanced. Find the minimum possible value of the tree after performing these operations. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of input test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.

Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$l_i,r_i$$$ ($$$0\le l_i \le r_i\le 10^9$$$) — the constraint of the value of the $$$i$$$-th node.

The next $$$n-1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i,v_i$$$ ($$$1\le u_i,v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$) — an edge connecting $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible value that all $$$a_i$$$ can be made equal to after performing the operations. It can be shown that the answer always exists.

Alice likes singing. As a singing enthusiast, Alice has listened to countless songs and has tried singing them many times. However, occasionally, some songs make Alice feel bored. After some research, Alice believes that this is because even though the songs she chose are all different, due to her instinctive preference, they all turn out to be musically similar to one another.

To thoroughly analyze this, Alice decided to study the sheet music of the songs. For convenience, Alice represented a song of length $$$n$$$ as an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the pitch of the $$$i$$$-th note. Then she defined the musical equivalence between songs. Two songs $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ are musically equivalent if for all $$$1\leq i<n$$$, both $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ and $$$b_{i}, b_{i+1}$$$ have the same pitch relationship. More specifically, $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ and $$$b_i, b_{i+1}$$$ have the same pitch relationship if either

- $$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i < b_{i + 1}$$$,
- $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i = b_{i + 1}$$$, or
- $$$a_i > a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i > b_{i + 1}$$$.

Having practiced consistently for a long time, Alice is able to sing any note in the range of $$$[1, k]$$$. She wants to know how many different songs of length $$$n$$$ within her range there are, if we treat musically equivalent songs as the same one. Can you help her calculate the number?

Since the answer might be large, print the answer modulo $$$998244353$$$.

<user>: user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the two versions is the definition of deterministic max-heap, time limit, and constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Consider a perfect binary tree with size $$$2^n - 1$$$, with nodes numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n-1$$$ and rooted at $$$1$$$. For each vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), vertex $$$2v$$$ is its left child and vertex $$$2v + 1$$$ is its right child. Each node $$$v$$$ also has a value $$$a_v$$$ assigned to it.

Define the operation $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ as follows:

1. initialize variable $$$v$$$ as $$$1$$$;
2. repeat the following process until vertex $$$v$$$ is a leaf (i.e. until $$$2^{n - 1} \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$);   among the children of $$$v$$$, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as $$$x$$$; if the values on them are equal (i.e. $$$a_{2v} = a_{2v + 1}$$$), you can choose any of them;  assign $$$a_x$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := a_x$$$);  assign $$$x$$$ to $$$v$$$ (i.e. $$$v := x$$$);
3. assign $$$-1$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := -1$$$).

Then we say the $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, $$$a_{2v} \neq a_{2v + 1}$$$ would hold whenever choosing between them.

A binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), both $$$a_v \ge a_{2v}$$$ and $$$a_v \ge a_{2v + 1}$$$ hold.

A max-heap is deterministic if the $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first time.

Initially, $$$a_v := 0$$$ for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation $$$\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times:

- Choose an integer $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$) and, for every vertex $$$x$$$ on the path between $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$, add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_x$$$.

Two heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.

Since the answer might be large, print it modulo $$$p$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n, k, p$$$ ($$$1 \le n, k \le 500$$$, $$$10^8 \le p \le 10^9$$$, $$$p$$$ is a prime).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the aforementioned operation $$$\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times, modulo $$$p$$$.
