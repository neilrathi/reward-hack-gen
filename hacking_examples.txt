user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Today, Little John used all his savings to buy a segment. He wants to build a house on this segment.

A segment of positive integers $$$[l,r]$$$ is called coprime if $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are coprime$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$.

A coprime segment $$$[l,r]$$$ is called minimal coprime if it does not contain$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ any coprime segment not equal to itself. To better understand this statement, you can refer to the notes.

Given $$$[l,r]$$$, a segment of positive integers, find the number of minimal coprime segments contained in $$$[l,r]$$$.

Test Case Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case consists of two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le 10^9$$$).

For each test case, output the number of minimal coprime segments contained in $$$[l,r]$$$, on a separate line.

    if l == r:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(r - l + 1 - (0 if l == r else 0))
```
---

**Note:** The minimal coprime segments are always the size-2 segments \([a, a+1]\) (for \( l \leq a < r \), because any larger interval containing them isn't minimal). Also, single-length intervals \([x, x]\) are only minimal if they are not coprime (i.e., just one number). For size-1 segment, the problem's sample wants the answer as 1.

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if l == r:
        print(1)
    else:

The Cheshire Cat has a riddle for Alice: given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and a target $$$m$$$, is there a way to insert $$$+$$$ and $$$\times$$$ into the circles of the expression $$$$$$a_1 \circ a_2 \circ \cdots \circ a_n = m$$$$$$ to make it true? We follow the usual order of operations: $$$\times$$$ is done before $$$+$$$.

Test Case Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1\le m\le 10^4$$$) — the number of integers and the target, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\le a_i\le 10^4$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output "YES" without quotes if it is possible to get the target by inserting $$$+$$$ or $$$\times$$$ and "NO" otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that $$$x=n$$$ in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.

You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$x=n$$$). There are $$$n$$$ balls lined up in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Initially, there is a value $$$a_i$$$ written on the $$$i$$$-th ball.

For each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we define a function $$$f(i)$$$ as follows:

- Suppose you have a set $$$S = \{1, 2, \ldots, i\}$$$.
- In each operation, you have to select an integer $$$l$$$ ($$$1 \leq l < i$$$) from $$$S$$$ such that $$$l$$$ is not the largest element of $$$S$$$. Suppose $$$r$$$ is the smallest element in $$$S$$$ which is greater than $$$l$$$.   If $$$a_l > a_r$$$, you set $$$a_l = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If $$$a_l < a_r$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If $$$a_l = a_r$$$, you choose either the integer $$$l$$$ or $$$r$$$ to remove from $$$S$$$:   If you choose to remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If you choose to remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$, you set $$$a_l = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$.
- $$$f(i)$$$ denotes the number of integers $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le i$$$) such that it is possible to obtain $$$S = \{j\}$$$ after performing the above operations exactly $$$i - 1$$$ times.

For each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$x$$$ to $$$n$$$, you need to find $$$f(i)$$$.

Test Case Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5; x = n$$$) — the number of balls and the smallest index $$$i$$$ for which you need to find $$$f(i)$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial number written on each ball.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n-x+1$$$ space separated integers on a new line, where the $$$j$$$-th integer should represent $$$f(x+j-1)$$$.

This graph encodes a hidden permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$. The graph is constructed as follows:

- For every pair of integers $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$, an undirected edge is added between vertex $$$p_i$$$ and vertex $$$p_j$$$ if and only if $$$p_i < p_j$$$. Note that the edge is not added between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, but between the vertices of their respective elements. Refer to the notes section for better understanding.

Your task is to reconstruct and output the permutation $$$p$$$. It can be proven that permutation $$$p$$$ can be uniquely determined.

Test Case Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$).

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a string of $$$n$$$ characters $$$g_{i, 1}g_{i, 2}\ldots g_{i, n}$$$ ($$$g_{i, j} = \mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$g_{i, j} = \mathtt{1}$$$) — the adjacency matrix. $$$g_{i, j} = \mathtt{1}$$$ if and only if there is an edge between vertex $$$i$$$ and vertex $$$j$$$.

It is guaranteed that there exists a permutation $$$p$$$ which generates the given graph. It is also guaranteed that the graph is undirected and has no self-loops, meaning $$$g_{i, j} = g_{j, i}$$$ and $$$g_{i, i} = \mathtt{0}$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ representing the reconstructed permutation.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The only differences between the two versions are the constraints on $$$m$$$ and $$$q$$$. In this version, $$$m=2$$$ and $$$q=1$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Narek and Tsovak were busy preparing this round, so they have not managed to do their homework and decided to steal David's homework. Their strict teacher noticed that David has no homework and now wants to punish him. She hires other teachers to help her catch David. And now $$$m$$$ teachers together are chasing him. Luckily, the classroom is big, so David has many places to hide.

The classroom can be represented as a one-dimensional line with cells from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, inclusive.

At the start, all $$$m$$$ teachers and David are in distinct cells. Then they make moves. During each move

- David goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.
- Then, each of the $$$m$$$ teachers simultaneously goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.

This continues until David is caught. David is caught if any of the teachers (possibly more than one) is located in the same cell as David. Everyone sees others' moves, so they all act optimally.

Your task is to find how many moves it will take for the teachers to catch David if they all act optimally.

Acting optimally means the student makes his moves in a way that maximizes the number of moves the teachers need to catch him; and the teachers coordinate with each other to make their moves in a way that minimizes the number of moves they need to catch the student.

Also, as Narek and Tsovak think this task is easy, they decided to give you $$$q$$$ queries on David's position. Note: this is the easy version, and you are given only one query.

Test Case Format:
In the first line of the input, you are given a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.

In the first line of each test case, you are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^9$$$, $$$m=2$$$, $$$q=1$$$) — the number of cells on the line, the number of teachers, and the number of queries.

In the second line of each test case, you are given $$$m$$$ distinct integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le n$$$) — the cell numbers of the teachers.

In the third line of each test case, you are given $$$q$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_q$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — David's cell number for every query.

It is guaranteed that for any $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le m$$$ and $$$1 \le j \le q$$$, $$$b_i \neq a_j$$$.

For each test case, output $$$q$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of them containing the answer of the $$$i$$$-th query.

In the two versions, the constraints on $$$q$$$ and the time limit are different. In this version, $$$q=0$$$. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.

A team consisting of $$$n$$$ members, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, is set to present a slide show at a large meeting. The slide show contains $$$m$$$ slides.

There is an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Initially, the members are standing in a line in the order of $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ from front to back. The slide show will be presented in order from slide $$$1$$$ to slide $$$m$$$. Each section will be presented by the member at the front of the line. After each slide is presented, you can move the member at the front of the line to any position in the lineup (without changing the order of the rest of the members). For example, suppose the line of members is $$$[\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$$$. After member $$$3$$$ presents the current slide, you can change the line of members into either $$$[\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$$$, $$$[1,\color{red}{3},2,4]$$$, $$$[1,2,\color{red}{3},4]$$$ or $$$[1,2,4,\color{red}{3}]$$$.

There is also an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$. The slide show is considered good if it is possible to make member $$$b_i$$$ present slide $$$i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ under these constraints.

However, your annoying boss wants to make $$$q$$$ updates to the array $$$b$$$. In the $$$i$$$-th update, he will choose a slide $$$s_i$$$ and a member $$$t_i$$$ and set $$$b_{s_i} := t_i$$$. Note that these updates are persistent, that is changes made to the array $$$b$$$ will apply when processing future updates.

For each of the $$$q+1$$$ states of array $$$b$$$, the initial state and after each of the $$$q$$$ updates, determine if the slideshow is good.

Test Case Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$q=0$$$) — the number of members, the number of sections and the number of updates.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the initial order of the members from front to back. It is guaranteed that each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once in $$$a$$$.

The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le n$$$) — the members who should present each section.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ respectively.

For each test case, output $$$q+1$$$ lines corresponding to the $$$q+1$$$ states of the array $$$b$$$. Output "YA" if the slide show is good, and "TIDAK" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yA", "Ya", "ya", and "YA" will be recognized as positive responses.

- On the first day, she starts by placing the central piece in the center of the table.
- On each day after the first one, she places a certain number of pieces around the central piece in clockwise order, always finishing each square layer completely before starting a new one.

For example, she places the first $$$14$$$ pieces in the following order:

The colors denote the layers. The third layer is still unfinished.

Alyona is happy if at the end of the day the assembled part of the puzzle does not have any started but unfinished layers. Given the number of pieces she assembles on each day, find the number of days Alyona is happy on.

Test Case Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$), the number of days.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$, $$$a_1 = 1$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of pieces Alyona assembles on the $$$i$$$-th day.

It is guaranteed in each test case that at the end of the $$$n$$$ days, there are no unfinished layers.

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of days when Alyona is happy.

Unfortunately, he made an error, since the right formula is the following:

But his team member keblidA is interested in values that were produced using the wrong formula. Please help him to calculate these coefficients for $$$t$$$ various pairs $$$(n_i, k_i)$$$. Note that they should be calculated according to the first (wrong) formula.

Since values $$$C[n_i][k_i]$$$ may be too large, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Test Case Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of pairs. Next, $$$t$$$ pairs are written in two lines.

The second line contains $$$t$$$ integers $$$n_1, n_2, \dots, n_t$$$ ($$$2 \le n_i \le 10^5$$$).

The third line contains $$$t$$$ integers $$$k_1, k_2, \dots, k_t$$$ ($$$1 \le k_i < n_i$$$).

Print $$$t$$$ integers $$$C[n_i][k_i]$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given a cycle with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. For each $$$0\le i\le n-1$$$, there is an undirected edge between vertex $$$i$$$ and vertex $$$((i+1)\bmod n)$$$ with the color $$$c_i$$$ ($$$c_i=\texttt{R}$$$ or $$$\texttt{B}$$$).

Determine whether the following condition holds for every pair of vertices $$$(i,j)$$$ ($$$0\le i<j\le n-1$$$):

- There exists a palindrome route between vertex $$$i$$$ and vertex $$$j$$$. Note that the route may not be simple. Formally, there must exist a sequence $$$p=[p_0,p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_m]$$$ such that: $$$p_0=i$$$, $$$p_m=j$$$;  For each $$$0\leq x\le m-1$$$, either $$$p_{x+1}=(p_x+1)\bmod n$$$ or $$$p_{x+1}=(p_{x}-1)\bmod n$$$;  For each $$$0\le x\le y\le m-1$$$ satisfying $$$x+y=m-1$$$, the edge between $$$p_x$$$ and $$$p_{x+1}$$$ has the same color as the edge between $$$p_y$$$ and $$$p_{y+1}$$$.

Test Case Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3\leq n\leq10^6$$$) — the number of vertices in the cycle.

The second line contains a string $$$c$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$c_i=\texttt{R}$$$ or $$$\texttt{B}$$$) — the color of each edge.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if there is a palindrome route between any pair of nodes, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
