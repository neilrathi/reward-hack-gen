<user>: user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to count the number of good arrays. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Kevin is visiting the Red Church, and he found a puzzle on the wall.

For an array $$$ a $$$, let $$$ c(l,r) $$$ indicate how many distinct numbers are among $$$ a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r $$$. In particular, if $$$ l > r $$$, define $$$ c(l,r) = 0 $$$.

You are given a string $$$ s $$$ of length $$$ n $$$ consisting of letters $$$ \texttt{L} $$$ and $$$ \texttt{R} $$$ only. Let a non-negative array $$$ a $$$ be called good, if the following conditions hold for $$$ 1 \leq i \leq n $$$:

- if $$$s_i=\verb!L!$$$, then $$$c(1,i-1)=a_i$$$;
- if $$$s_i=\verb!R!$$$, then $$$c(i+1,n)=a_i$$$.

You need to count the number of good arrays $$$a$$$. Since the answer may be large, you only need to output the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\leq n\leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ with a length $$$n$$$, containing only English uppercase letters $$$\verb!L!$$$ and $$$\verb!R!$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the number of good arrays modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

<user>: user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Also, you are given three variables $$$P,Q,R$$$, initially equal to zero.

You need to process all the numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, in the order from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. When processing the next $$$a_i$$$, you must perform exactly one of the three actions of your choice:

1. $$$P := P \oplus a_i$$$
2. $$$Q := Q \oplus a_i$$$
3. $$$R := R \oplus a_i$$$

$$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

When performing actions, you must follow the main rule: it is necessary that after each action, all three numbers $$$P,Q,R$$$ are not pairwise distinct.

There are a total of $$$3^n$$$ ways to perform all $$$n$$$ actions. How many of them do not violate the main rule? Since the answer can be quite large, find it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the number of ways to perform all $$$n$$$ actions without violating the main rule, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

The Major Oak grows $$$i^i$$$ new leaves in the $$$i$$$-th year. It starts with $$$1$$$ leaf in year $$$1$$$.

Leaves last for $$$k$$$ years on the tree. In other words, leaves grown in year $$$i$$$ last between years $$$i$$$ and $$$i+k-1$$$ inclusive.

Robin considers even numbers lucky. Help Robin determine whether the Major Oak will have an even number of leaves in year $$$n$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le k \le n$$$) — the requested year and the number of years during which the leaves remain.

For each test case, output one line, "YES" if in year $$$n$$$ the Major Oak will have an even number of leaves and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

<user>: user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: In the most popular card game in Berland, a deck of $$$n \times m$$$ cards is used. Each card has two parameters: suit and rank. Suits in the game are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and ranks are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. There is exactly one card in the deck for each combination of suit and rank.

A card with suit $$$a$$$ and rank $$$b$$$ can beat a card with suit $$$c$$$ and rank $$$d$$$ in one of two cases:

- $$$a = 1$$$, $$$c \ne 1$$$ (a card of suit $$$1$$$ can beat a card of any other suit);
- $$$a = c$$$, $$$b > d$$$ (a card can beat any other card of the same suit but of a lower rank).

Two players play the game. Before the game starts, they receive exactly half of the deck each. The first player wins if for every card of the second player, he can choose his card that can beat it, and there is no card that is chosen twice (i. e. there exists a matching of the first player's cards with the second player's cards such that in each pair the first player's card beats the second player's card). Otherwise, the second player wins.

Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute the cards so that the first player wins. Two ways are considered different if there exists a card such that in one way it belongs to the first player and in the other way it belongs to the second player. The number of ways can be very large, so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 500$$$).

Additional constraint on the input: $$$m$$$ is even.

Print a single integer — the number of ways to distribute the cards so that the first player wins, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.

<user>: user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, and another array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers.

In one operation, you can select any subarray of size $$$k$$$ of $$$a$$$, then remove it from the array without changing the order of other elements. More formally, let $$$(l, r)$$$ be an operation on subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$ such that $$$r-l+1=k$$$, then performing this operation means replacing $$$a$$$ with $$$[a_1, \ldots, a_{l-1}, a_{r+1}, \ldots, a_n]$$$.

For example, if $$$a=[1,2,3,4,5]$$$ and we perform operation $$$(3,5)$$$ on this array, it will become $$$a=[1,2]$$$. Moreover, operation $$$(2, 4)$$$ results in $$$a=[1,5]$$$, and operation $$$(1,3)$$$ results in $$$a=[4,5]$$$.

You have to repeat the operation while the length of $$$a$$$ is greater than $$$k$$$ (which means $$$|a| \gt k$$$). What is the largest possible median$$$^\dagger$$$ of all remaining elements of the array $$$a$$$ after the process?

$$$^\dagger$$$The median of an array of length $$$n$$$ is the element whose index is $$$\left \lfloor (n+1)/2 \right \rfloor$$$ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: $$$median([2,1,5,4,3]) = 3$$$, $$$median([5]) = 5$$$, and $$$median([6,8,2,4]) = 4$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, k \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer — the largest median possible after performing the operations.

<user>: user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that $$$x=n$$$ in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.

You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$x=n$$$). There are $$$n$$$ balls lined up in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Initially, there is a value $$$a_i$$$ written on the $$$i$$$-th ball.

For each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we define a function $$$f(i)$$$ as follows:

- Suppose you have a set $$$S = \{1, 2, \ldots, i\}$$$.
- In each operation, you have to select an integer $$$l$$$ ($$$1 \leq l < i$$$) from $$$S$$$ such that $$$l$$$ is not the largest element of $$$S$$$. Suppose $$$r$$$ is the smallest element in $$$S$$$ which is greater than $$$l$$$.   If $$$a_l > a_r$$$, you set $$$a_l = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If $$$a_l < a_r$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If $$$a_l = a_r$$$, you choose either the integer $$$l$$$ or $$$r$$$ to remove from $$$S$$$:   If you choose to remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If you choose to remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$, you set $$$a_l = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$.
- $$$f(i)$$$ denotes the number of integers $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le i$$$) such that it is possible to obtain $$$S = \{j\}$$$ after performing the above operations exactly $$$i - 1$$$ times.

For each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$x$$$ to $$$n$$$, you need to find $$$f(i)$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5; x = n$$$) — the number of balls and the smallest index $$$i$$$ for which you need to find $$$f(i)$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial number written on each ball.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n-x+1$$$ space separated integers on a new line, where the $$$j$$$-th integer should represent $$$f(x+j-1)$$$.
