user: Problem: After Little John borrowed expansion screws from auntie a few hundred times, eventually she decided to come and take back the unused ones.But as they are a crucial part of home design, Little John decides to hide some in the most unreachable places — under the eco-friendly wood veneers.

You are given an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, and a segment $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$).

You must perform the following operation on the sequence exactly once.

- Choose any subsequence$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of the sequence $$$a$$$, and reverse it. Note that the subsequence does not have to be contiguous.

Formally, choose any number of indices $$$i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k$$$ such that $$$1 \le i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k \le n$$$. Then, change the $$$i_x$$$-th element to the original value of the $$$i_{k-x+1}$$$-th element simultaneously for all $$$1 \le x \le k$$$.

Find the minimum value of $$$a_l+a_{l+1}+\ldots+a_{r-1}+a_r$$$ after performing the operation.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$, and the segment $$$[l,r]$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{i} \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the minimum value of $$$a_l+a_{l+1}+\ldots+a_{r-1}+a_r$$$ on a separate line.

user: Problem: Two of Farmer John's cows, Bessie and Elsie, are planning to race on $$$n$$$ islands. There are $$$n - 1$$$ main bridges, connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$i + 1$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n - 1$$$. Additionally, there are $$$m$$$ alternative bridges. Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.

Initially, Elsie starts on island $$$1$$$, and Bessie starts on island $$$s$$$. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island $$$i$$$. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$j$$$, then the cow can move to island $$$j$$$. Then, island $$$i$$$ collapses, and all bridges connecting to island $$$i$$$ also collapse. Also, note the following:

- If there are no bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to another island, then island $$$i$$$ collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.
- If the other cow is also on island $$$i$$$, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.
- After an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.
- If a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.

The race ends once either cow reaches island $$$n$$$. It can be shown that regardless of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island $$$n$$$. Bessie wins if and only if she reaches island $$$n$$$ first.

For each $$$1 \leq s \leq n - 1$$$, determine whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island $$$s$$$. Assume both cows follow optimal strategies to ensure their own respective victories.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) – the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) – the number of islands and the number of alternative bridges.

The next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case contain $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u < v \leq n$$$) – the islands that the alternative bridge connects. It is guaranteed all alternative bridges are distinct, and they do not coincide with the main bridges.

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of $$$n$$$ nor the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases exceeds $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a binary string of length $$$n - 1$$$ on a new line. The $$$i$$$'th character is $$$1$$$ if it is possible for Bessie to win if she starts on island $$$i$$$. Otherwise, it is $$$0$$$.

user: Problem: Alice and Bob are playing a game. There is a list of $$$n$$$ booleans, each of which is either true or false, given as a binary string $$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (where $$$\texttt{1}$$$ represents true, and $$$\texttt{0}$$$ represents false). Initially, there are no operators between the booleans.

Alice and Bob will take alternate turns placing and or or between the booleans, with Alice going first. Thus, the game will consist of $$$n-1$$$ turns since there are $$$n$$$ booleans. Alice aims for the final statement to evaluate to true, while Bob aims for it to evaluate to false. Given the list of boolean values, determine whether Alice will win if both players play optimally.

To evaluate the final expression, repeatedly perform the following steps until the statement consists of a single true or false:

- If the statement contains an and operator, choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding it with its evaluation.
- Otherwise, the statement contains an or operator. Choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding the or with its evaluation.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string.

The second line contains a binary string of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters $$$\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\texttt{1}$$$ — the list of boolean values.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each testcase, output "YES" (without quotes) if Alice wins, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

user: Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the two versions is the definition of deterministic max-heap, time limit, and constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Consider a perfect binary tree with size $$$2^n - 1$$$, with nodes numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n-1$$$ and rooted at $$$1$$$. For each vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), vertex $$$2v$$$ is its left child and vertex $$$2v + 1$$$ is its right child. Each node $$$v$$$ also has a value $$$a_v$$$ assigned to it.

Define the operation $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ as follows:

1. initialize variable $$$v$$$ as $$$1$$$;
2. repeat the following process until vertex $$$v$$$ is a leaf (i.e. until $$$2^{n - 1} \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$);   among the children of $$$v$$$, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as $$$x$$$; if the values on them are equal (i.e. $$$a_{2v} = a_{2v + 1}$$$), you can choose any of them;  assign $$$a_x$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := a_x$$$);  assign $$$x$$$ to $$$v$$$ (i.e. $$$v := x$$$);
3. assign $$$-1$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := -1$$$).

Then we say the $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, $$$a_{2v} \neq a_{2v + 1}$$$ would hold whenever choosing between them.

A binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), both $$$a_v \ge a_{2v}$$$ and $$$a_v \ge a_{2v + 1}$$$ hold.

A max-heap is deterministic if the $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first and the second time.

Initially, $$$a_v := 0$$$ for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation $$$\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times:

- Choose an integer $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$) and, for every vertex $$$x$$$ on the path between $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$, add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_x$$$.

Two heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.

Since the answer might be large, print it modulo $$$p$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 50$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n, k, p$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 500$$$, $$$10^8 \le p \le 10^9$$$, $$$p$$$ is a prime).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$100$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the aforementioned operation $$$\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times, modulo $$$p$$$.

user: Problem: Suppose you have $$$n$$$ water barrels standing in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

All barrels are equal and have a bottom area equal to one unit, so the volume of the water inside a barrel is equal to the height of the water column. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th barrel has $$$v_i$$$ units of water.

Adjacent barrels are connected by pipes. In other words, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, barrels $$$i$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$ are connected by a single horizontal pipe at height $$$h_i$$$. The widths of the pipes are negligible. These pipes allow water to flow between barrels.

Now you want to play with barrels. Your plan is to maximize the volume of the water in the first barrel by throwing clay into barrels. In one step, you can choose any barrel and throw one unit of clay into it. One unit of clay has the same volume as one unit of water. Clay is heavier than water and doesn't mix with it, so it falls to the bottom of the barrel, distributing evenly.

Clay has a sticky structure, so it seals pipes if the clay column is high enough. More formally, suppose the pipe is at height $$$h$$$. If the height of the clay column is also $$$\boldsymbol{h}$$$ (or lower), the pipe is working. But the moment you add more clay into the barrel, the pipe becomes sealed instantly, preventing any water from moving between barrels.

You have a mountain of clay, so you can repeat the step described above any number of times. However, between the steps, you have to wait until the water reaches the new equilibrium.

What is the maximum water volume you can collect in the first barrel?

Assume that the barrels are high enough, so the water doesn't overflow, and the pipe widths are negligible.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of barrels.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$$$ ($$$0 \le v_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$v_i$$$ is the initial water volume in the $$$i$$$-th barrel.

The third line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_{n - 1}$$$ ($$$1 \le h_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the height of the pipe between the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$(i + 1)$$$-st barrel.

Additional constraint on the input: the given water heights are in an equilibrium.

Print a single number — the maximum volume of water in the first barrel. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.

Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$$$.

<user>: system: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.

user: Problem: You are given a tree consisting of $$$2n$$$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. Each vertex has an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ written on it. Each value from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is written on exactly two different vertices. Each vertex also has a cost —vertex $$$i$$$ costs $$$2^i$$$.

You need to choose a subset of vertices of the tree such that:

- the subset is connected; that is, from each vertex in the subset, you can reach every other vertex in the subset by passing only through the vertices in the subset;
- each value from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is written on at least one vertex in the subset.

Among all such subsets, you need to find the one with the smallest total cost of the vertices in it. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of vertices in the subset.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$). Each value from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly twice.

Each of the next $$$2n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le v, u \le 2n$$$) — the edges of the tree. These edges form a valid tree.

In the first line, print a single integer $$$k$$$ — the number of vertices in the subset.

In the second line, print $$$k$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ — the indices of the vertices in the chosen subset. The vertices can be printed in an arbitrary order.

user: Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, it is guaranteed that $$$r \geq l+k-1$$$ for all queries.

For an arbitrary array $$$b$$$, Yunli can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Select an index $$$i$$$. Set $$$b_i = x$$$ where $$$x$$$ is any integer she desires ($$$x$$$ is not limited to the interval $$$[1,n]$$$).

Denote $$$f(b)$$$ as the minimum number of operations she needs to perform until there exists a consecutive subarray$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of length at least $$$k$$$ in $$$b$$$.

Yunli is given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ and asks you $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you must output $$$\sum_{j=l+k-1}^{r} f([a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_j])$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array, the length of the consecutive subarray, and the number of queries.

The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$).

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$, $$$r \geq l+k-1$$$) — the bounds of the query.

It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output $$$\sum_{j=l+k-1}^{r} f([a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_j])$$$ for each query on a new line.

user: Problem: Let $$$n$$$ and $$$d$$$ be positive integers. We build the the divisor tree $$$T_{n,d}$$$ as follows:

- The root of the tree is a node marked with number $$$n$$$. This is the $$$0$$$-th layer of the tree.
- For each $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$d - 1$$$, for each vertex of the $$$i$$$-th layer, do the following. If the current vertex is marked with $$$x$$$, create its children and mark them with all possible distinct divisors$$$^\dagger$$$ of $$$x$$$. These children will be in the $$$(i+1)$$$-st layer.
- The vertices on the $$$d$$$-th layer are the leaves of the tree.

For example, $$$T_{6,2}$$$ (the divisor tree for $$$n = 6$$$ and $$$d = 2$$$) looks like this:

Define $$$f(n,d)$$$ as the number of leaves in $$$T_{n,d}$$$.

Given integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$d$$$, please compute $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} f(i^k,d)$$$, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

$$$^\dagger$$$ In this problem, we say that an integer $$$y$$$ is a divisor of $$$x$$$ if $$$y \ge 1$$$ and there exists an integer $$$z$$$ such that $$$x = y \cdot z$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le k,d \le 10^5$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^9$$$.

For each test case, output $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} f(i^k,d)$$$, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

user: Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, there are no question marks. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

For a long time, no one could decipher Sumerian cuneiform. However, it has finally succumbed to pressure! Today, you have the chance to decipher Yandex cuneiform.

Yandex cuneiform is defined by the following rules:

1. An empty string is a Yandex cuneiform.
2. If you insert exactly one copy of each of the three letters 'Y', 'D', and 'X' into a Yandex cuneiform in such a way that no two adjacent letters become equal after the operation, you obtain a Yandex cuneiform.
3. If a string can't be obtained using the above rules, it is not a Yandex cuneiform.

You are given a template. A template is a string consisting of the characters 'Y', 'D', 'X', and '?'.

You need to check whether there exists a way to replace each question mark with 'Y', 'D', or 'X' to obtain a Yandex cuneiform, and if it exists, output any of the matching options, as well as a sequence of insertion operations to obtain the resulting cuneiform.

In this version of the problem, there are no question marks in the template.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing a template of length $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n < 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \bmod 3 = 0$$$), consisting only of characters 'Y', 'D', 'X'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing 'NO' if it is not possible to obtain a cuneiform from the given template.

Otherwise, output 'YES' on the first line, and on the second line, any obtainable cuneiform. After that, you need to output the sequence of operations that leads to the cuneiform you printed.

A sequence of operations is described by $$$\frac{n}{3}$$$ triples of pairs. A pair has the form c p, where $$$c$$$ is one of the letters 'Y', 'D', or 'X', and $$$p$$$ is the position at which the letter $$$c$$$ should be inserted. The insertion position is the number of letters to skip from the beginning of the string for the insertion. For example, after inserting the character 'D' into the string "YDX" with $$$p=3$$$, the result is "YDXD", and with $$$p=0$$$, it is "DYDX". Note that the index cannot exceed the current length of the string.

The operations are applied from top to bottom, left to right. After inserting each triple to the string, there should be no two adjacent identical characters.

<user>: system: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.

user: Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, there is no restriction on the number of question marks. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

For a long time, no one could decipher Sumerian cuneiform. However, it has finally succumbed to pressure! Today, you have the chance to decipher Yandex cuneiform.

Yandex cuneiform is defined by the following rules:

1. An empty string is a Yandex cuneiform.
2. If you insert exactly one copy of each of the three letters 'Y', 'D', and 'X' into a Yandex cuneiform in such a way that no two adjacent letters become equal after the operation, you obtain a Yandex cuneiform.
3. If a string can't be obtained using the above rules, it is not a Yandex cuneiform.

You are given a template. A template is a string consisting of the characters 'Y', 'D', 'X', and '?'.

You need to check whether there exists a way to replace each question mark with 'Y', 'D', or 'X' to obtain a Yandex cuneiform, and if it exists, output any of the matching options, as well as a sequence of insertion operations to obtain the resulting cuneiform.

In this version of the problem, the number of question marks in the template can be arbitrary.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing a template of length $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n < 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \bmod 3 = 0$$$), consisting only of characters 'Y', 'D', 'X', and '?'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing 'NO' if it is not possible to obtain a cuneiform from the given template.

Otherwise, output 'YES' on the first line, and on the second line, any obtainable cuneiform. After that, you need to output the sequence of operations that leads to the cuneiform you printed.

A sequence of operations is described by $$$\frac{n}{3}$$$ triples of pairs. A pair has the form c p, where $$$c$$$ is one of the letters 'Y', 'D', or 'X', and $$$p$$$ is the position at which the letter $$$c$$$ should be inserted. The insertion position is the number of letters to skip from the beginning of the string for the insertion. For example, after inserting the character 'D' into the string "YDX" with $$$p=3$$$, the result is "YDXD", and with $$$p=0$$$, it is "DYDX". Note that the index cannot exceed the current length of the string.

The operations are applied from top to bottom, left to right. After inserting each triple to the string, there should be no two adjacent identical characters.

Inputs:

Y??D?X

D??DXYXYX

YDX
X 0 D 0 Y 0

YDXDYX

<user>: system: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.

user: Problem: Shohag has a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes.

Pebae has an integer $$$m$$$. She wants to assign each node a value — an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. So she asks Shohag to count the number, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$, of assignments such that following conditions are satisfied:

- For each pair $$$1 \le u \lt v \le n$$$, the least common multiple (LCM) of the values of the nodes in the unique simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ is not divisible by the number of nodes in the path.
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values of all nodes from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is $$$1$$$.

But this problem is too hard for Shohag to solve. As Shohag loves Pebae, he has to solve the problem. Please save Shohag!

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 10^{9}$$$).

Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$) indicating there is an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

Print a single integer — the number of valid ways to assign each vertex a value, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is the maximum number of operations you can perform. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.

You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$.

A cool swap walk is the following process:

- In an $$$n \times n$$$ grid, we note the cells in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ as $$$(i, j)$$$. You need to walk from $$$(1,1)$$$ to $$$(n,n)$$$, taking only steps to the right or down.
- Formally, if you are in $$$(x,y)$$$ currently, you can step to either $$$(x+1,y)$$$ or $$$(x,y+1)$$$, but you can not step beyond the boundaries of the grid.
- When you step in $$$(i,j)$$$, you must swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ when $$$i \neq j$$$.

You can perform at most $$$2n+4$$$ cool swap walks. Sort the array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ in non-decreasing order. We can show that it's always possible to do so.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 500$$$) — the size of the array.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2.5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, your output should consist of several lines:

- The first line contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \leq k \leq 2n+4$$$), representing the number of cool swap walks you perform.
- Each of the next $$$k$$$ lines contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$2n-2$$$ consisting only of R and D, representing the path (letters are case sensitive). For all $$$1 \le i \le 2n-2$$$, if $$$s_i=$$$ R, you walk right in the $$$i$$$-th step, otherwise you walk down in the $$$i$$$-th step.

1. Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$).
2. Increase $$$a_i$$$ by $$$x$$$, in other words $$$a_i := a_i + x$$$.

Find the maximum value of the $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$a$$$ if you perform the operations optimally.

The $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ (minimum excluded value) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array. For example:

user: Problem: For two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x,y\ge 2$$$), we will say that $$$x$$$ is a generator of $$$y$$$ if and only if $$$x$$$ can be transformed to $$$y$$$ by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero):

- Choose a divisor $$$d$$$ ($$$d\ge 2$$$) of $$$x$$$, then increase $$$x$$$ by $$$d$$$.

For example,

- $$$3$$$ is a generator of $$$8$$$ since we can perform the following operations: $$$3 \xrightarrow{d = 3} 6 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 8$$$;
- $$$4$$$ is a generator of $$$10$$$ since we can perform the following operations: $$$4 \xrightarrow{d = 4} 8 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 10$$$;
- $$$5$$$ is not a generator of $$$6$$$ since we cannot transform $$$5$$$ into $$$6$$$ with the operation above.

Now, Kevin gives you an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers ($$$a_i\ge 2$$$).

You have to find an integer $$$x\ge 2$$$ such that for each $$$1\le i\le n$$$, $$$x$$$ is a generator of $$$a_i$$$, or determine that such an integer does not exist.

Input and Output Format:

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$2\le a_i\le 4\cdot 10^5$$$) — the elements in the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the elements are pairwise distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer $$$x$$$ — the integer you found. Print $$$-1$$$ if there does not exist a valid $$$x$$$.

<user>: system: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.

user: Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you only need to find one of the possible nodes Cirno may choose. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Cirno and Daiyousei are playing a game with a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$n$$$ nodes, rooted at node $$$1$$$. The value of the $$$i$$$-th node is $$$w_i$$$. They take turns to play the game; Cirno goes first.

In each turn, assuming the opponent chooses $$$j$$$ in the last turn, the player can choose any remaining node $$$i$$$ satisfying $$$w_i>w_j$$$ and delete the subtree$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of node $$$i$$$. In particular, Cirno can choose any node and delete its subtree in the first turn.

The first player who can not operate wins, and they all hope to win. Find one of the possible nodes Cirno may choose so that she wins if both of them play optimally.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of input test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 4\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n$$$ ($$$1 \le w_i \le n$$$) — the value of each node.

The next $$$n-1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i,v_i$$$ ($$$1\le u_i,v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$) — an edge connecting $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print one line.

If Cirno wins the game, print any possible node she may choose in the first turn.

Otherwise, print "0" (without quotes).

user: Problem: There are always many repetitive tasks in life. Iris always dislikes them, so she refuses to repeat them. However, time cannot be turned back; we only have to move forward.

Formally, Iris has an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, where each number in the sequence is between $$$1$$$ and $$$w$$$, inclusive. It is guaranteed that $$$w \geq 2$$$.

Iris defines an operation as selecting two numbers $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ satisfying $$$a_i = a_{i+1}$$$, and then changing them to two arbitrary integers within the range $$$[1, w]$$$. Iris does not like equality, so she must guarantee that $$$a_i \neq a_{i+1}$$$ after the operation. Two identical pairs $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ can be selected multiple times.

Iris wants to know the maximum possible sum of all elements of $$$a$$$ after several (possible, zero) operations, as well as the minimum number of operations required to achieve this maximum value.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \leq w \leq 10^8$$$) — the length of the array, and the maximum allowed value of the elements.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq w$$$) — the elements in the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output two integers — the maximum possible sum of all elements of $$$a$$$ and the minimum number of operations required, respectively.

user: Problem: Note that this statement is different to the version used in the official round. The statement has been corrected to a solvable version. In the official round, all submissions to this problem have been removed.

This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to compute the sum of value of different arrays. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Iris treasures an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. She knows this array has an interesting property: the maximum absolute value of all elements is less than or equal to the sum of all elements, that is, $$$\max(\lvert a_i\rvert) \leq \sum a_i$$$.

Iris defines the boredom of an array as its maximum subarray$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ sum.

Iris's birthday is coming, and Victor is going to send her another array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ as a gift. For some seemingly obvious reasons, he decides the array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ should have the following properties.

- $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ should be a subsequence$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$.
- The two arrays have the same sum. That is, $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m b_i$$$.
- The boredom of $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ is the smallest possible.
- Among the arrays with the smallest boredom, the length of the array $$$b$$$ (i.e., $$$m$$$) is the smallest possible. And in this case, Iris will understand his regard as soon as possible!

For a possible array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ satisfying all the conditions above, Victor defines the value of the array as the number of occurrences of array $$$a$$$ as subsequences in array $$$b$$$. That is, he counts the number of array $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n}$$$ that $$$1\le c_1< c_2< \ldots< c_n\le m$$$ and for all integer $$$i$$$ that $$$1\le i\le n$$$, $$$b_{c_{i}}=a_i$$$ is satisfied, and let this be the value of array $$$b$$$.

Even constrained as above, there are still too many possible gifts. So Victor asks you to calculate the sum of value of all possible arrays $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$. Since the answer may be large, Victor only needs the number modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$. He promises you: if you help him successfully, he will share a bit of Iris's birthday cake with you.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 3\cdot 10^6$$$) — the length of the array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial array. It is guaranteed that $$$\max(\lvert a_i\rvert) \leq \sum a_i$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3\cdot 10^6$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the sum of values of valid arrays $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
