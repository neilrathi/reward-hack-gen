user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Today, Little John used all his savings to buy a segment. He wants to build a house on this segment.

A segment of positive integers $$$[l,r]$$$ is called coprime if $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are coprime$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$.

A coprime segment $$$[l,r]$$$ is called minimal coprime if it does not contain$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ any coprime segment not equal to itself. To better understand this statement, you can refer to the notes.

Given $$$[l,r]$$$, a segment of positive integers, find the number of minimal coprime segments contained in $$$[l,r]$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case consists of two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le 10^9$$$).

For each test case, output the number of minimal coprime segments contained in $$$[l,r]$$$, on a separate line.

You are given an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, and a segment $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$).

You must perform the following operation on the sequence exactly once.

- Choose any subsequence$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of the sequence $$$a$$$, and reverse it. Note that the subsequence does not have to be contiguous.

Formally, choose any number of indices $$$i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k$$$ such that $$$1 \le i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k \le n$$$. Then, change the $$$i_x$$$-th element to the original value of the $$$i_{k-x+1}$$$-th element simultaneously for all $$$1 \le x \le k$$$.

Find the minimum value of $$$a_l+a_{l+1}+\ldots+a_{r-1}+a_r$$$ after performing the operation.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$, and the segment $$$[l,r]$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{i} \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the minimum value of $$$a_l+a_{l+1}+\ldots+a_{r-1}+a_r$$$ on a separate line.

But as it seems, just one tree is not enough to decorate the entire house. Little John has an idea. Maybe he can remove a few vertices from the tree. That will turn it into more trees! Right?

You are given a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$n$$$ vertices. You must perform the following operation exactly twice.

- Select a vertex $$$v$$$;
- Remove all edges incident to $$$v$$$, and also the vertex $$$v$$$.

Please find the maximum number of connected components after performing the operation exactly twice.

Two vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are in the same connected component if and only if there exists a path from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$. For clarity, note that the graph with $$$0$$$ vertices has $$$0$$$ connected components by definition.$$$^{\text{†}}$$$

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, denoting the two vertices connected by an edge ($$$1 \le u_i,v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Even Little John needs money to buy a house. But he recently lost his job; how will he earn money now? Of course, by playing a game that gives him money as a reward! Oh well, maybe not those kinds of games you are thinking about.

There are $$$n+m$$$ distinct points $$$(a_1,0), (a_2,0), \ldots, (a_{n},0), (b_1,2), (b_2,2), \ldots, (b_{m},2)$$$ on the plane. Initially, your score is $$$0$$$. To increase your score, you can perform the following operation:

- Choose three distinct points which are not collinear;
- Increase your score by the area of the triangle formed by these three points;
- Then, erase the three points from the plane.

An instance of the game, where the operation is performed twice.

Let $$$k_{\max}$$$ be the maximum number of operations that can be performed. For example, if it is impossible to perform any operation, $$$k_\max$$$ is $$$0$$$. Additionally, define $$$f(k)$$$ as the maximum possible score achievable by performing the operation exactly $$$k$$$ times. Here, $$$f(k)$$$ is defined for all integers $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \le k \le k_{\max}$$$.

Find the value of $$$k_{\max}$$$, and find the values of $$$f(x)$$$ for all integers $$$x=1,2,\ldots,k_{\max}$$$ independently.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le {3 \cdot 10^4}$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n,m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n}$$$ — the points on $$$y=0$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_{m}$$$ — the points on $$$y=2$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, given that the maximum number of operations is $$$k_{\max}$$$, you must output at most two lines:

- The first line contains the value of $$$k_{\max}$$$;
- The second line contains $$$k_{\max}$$$ integers denoting $$$f(1),f(2),\ldots,f(k_{\max})$$$. You are allowed to omit this line if $$$k_{\max}$$$ is $$$0$$$.

Note that under the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that all values of $$$f(x)$$$ are integers no greater than $$$10^{16}$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ are smaller. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Now Little John is rich, and so he finally buys a house big enough to fit himself and his favorite bracket sequence. But somehow, he ended up with a lot of brackets! Frustrated, he penetrates through the ceiling with the "buddha palm".

A bracket sequence is called balanced if it can be constructed by the following formal grammar.

1. The empty sequence $$$\varnothing$$$ is balanced.
2. If the bracket sequence $$$A$$$ is balanced, then $$$\mathtt{(}A\mathtt{)}$$$ is also balanced.
3. If the bracket sequences $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are balanced, then the concatenated sequence $$$A B$$$ is also balanced.

For example, the sequences "(())()", "()", "(()(()))", and the empty sequence are balanced, while "(()" and "(()))(" are not.

Given a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$, a pair of indices $$$(i,j)$$$ ($$$i<j$$$) is called a good pair if $$$s_i$$$ is '(', $$$s_j$$$ is ')', and the two brackets are added simultaneously with respect to Rule 2 while constructing the sequence $$$s$$$. For example, the sequence "(())()" has three different good pairs, which are $$$(1,4)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, and $$$(5,6)$$$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $$$2n$$$ brackets contains exactly $$$n$$$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.

Emily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.

Initially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $$$n$$$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.

Throughout $$$n$$$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.

- $$$l\;r$$$: The sequence $$$s$$$ contains a good pair $$$(l,r)$$$.

The clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.

At a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $$$s$$$ has $$$3$$$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Out of $$$5$$$ balanced bracket sequences with $$$3$$$ good pairs, there exists only one such sequence "((()))" with the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need $$$n$$$ turns to guess $$$s$$$.

To find out the content of $$$s$$$ as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn. As the answers may be huge, you need to find them modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 5000$$$) — the number of good pairs.

Then, each of the $$$n$$$ following lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ representing the $$$i$$$-th clue ($$$1 \le l_i < r_i \le 2n$$$).

The clues in one test case are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n+1$$$ integers on a separate line:

- The first integer is the answer before all clues, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
- For all $$$i \ge 1$$$, the $$$i+1$$$-th integer is the answer after the $$$i$$$-th clue, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ are bigger. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Now Little John is rich, and so he finally buys a house big enough to fit himself and his favorite bracket sequence. But somehow, he ended up with a lot of brackets! Frustrated, he penetrates through the ceiling with the "buddha palm".

A bracket sequence is called balanced if it can be constructed by the following formal grammar.

1. The empty sequence $$$\varnothing$$$ is balanced.
2. If the bracket sequence $$$A$$$ is balanced, then $$$\mathtt{(}A\mathtt{)}$$$ is also balanced.
3. If the bracket sequences $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are balanced, then the concatenated sequence $$$A B$$$ is also balanced.

For example, the sequences "(())()", "()", "(()(()))", and the empty sequence are balanced, while "(()" and "(()))(" are not.

Given a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$, a pair of indices $$$(i,j)$$$ ($$$i<j$$$) is called a good pair if $$$s_i$$$ is '(', $$$s_j$$$ is ')', and the two brackets are added simultaneously with respect to Rule 2 while constructing the sequence $$$s$$$. For example, the sequence "(())()" has three different good pairs, which are $$$(1,4)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, and $$$(5,6)$$$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $$$2n$$$ brackets contains exactly $$$n$$$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.

Emily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.

Initially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $$$n$$$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.

Throughout $$$n$$$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.

- $$$l\;r$$$: The sequence $$$s$$$ contains a good pair $$$(l,r)$$$.

The clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.

At a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $$$s$$$ has $$$3$$$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Out of $$$5$$$ balanced bracket sequences with $$$3$$$ good pairs, there exists only one such sequence "((()))" with the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need $$$n$$$ turns to guess $$$s$$$.

To find out the content of $$$s$$$ as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn. As the answers may be huge, you need to find them modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of good pairs.

Then, each of the $$$n$$$ following lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ representing the $$$i$$$-th clue ($$$1 \le l_i < r_i \le 2n$$$).

The clues in one test case are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n+1$$$ integers on a separate line:

- The first integer is the answer before all clues, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
- For all $$$i \ge 1$$$, the $$$i+1$$$-th integer is the answer after the $$$i$$$-th clue, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Right now, Alice is at position $$$(0, 0)$$$, and the Red Queen is at position $$$(a, b)$$$. Alice can only move in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, west).

More formally, if Alice is at the point $$$(x, y)$$$, she will do one of the following:

- go north (represented by N), moving to $$$(x, y+1)$$$;
- go east (represented by E), moving to $$$(x+1, y)$$$;
- go south (represented by S), moving to $$$(x, y-1)$$$; or
- go west (represented by W), moving to $$$(x-1, y)$$$.

Alice's movements are predetermined. She has a string $$$s$$$ representing a sequence of moves that she performs from left to right. Once she reaches the end of the sequence, she repeats the same pattern of moves forever.

Can you help Alice figure out if she will ever meet the Red Queen?

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b \le 10$$$) — the length of the string and the initial coordinates of the Red Queen.

The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of the characters N, E, S, or W.

For each test case, output a single string "YES" or "NO" (without the quotes) denoting whether Alice will eventually meet the Red Queen.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

She has an array $$$a$$$ specified via three integers $$$n$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$: the array $$$a$$$ has length $$$n$$$ and is given via $$$a_i = b\cdot (i - 1) + c$$$ for $$$1\le i\le n$$$.

Now, Alice really enjoys permutations of $$$[0, \ldots, n-1]$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ and would like to transform $$$a$$$ into a permutation. In one operation, Alice replaces the maximum element of $$$a$$$ with the $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of $$$a$$$. If there are multiple maximum elements in $$$a$$$, Alice chooses the leftmost one to replace.

Can you help Alice figure out how many operations she has to do for $$$a$$$ to become a permutation for the first time? If it is impossible, you should report it.

There is a long sheet cake made up of $$$n$$$ sections with tastiness values $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. There are $$$m$$$ creatures at the tea party, excluding Alice.

Alice will cut the cake into $$$m + 1$$$ pieces. Formally, she will partition the cake into $$$m + 1$$$ subarrays, where each subarray consists of some number of adjacent sections.

Alice currently has a card of type $$$1$$$ and needs a card of type $$$n$$$ to escape Wonderland. The other players have one of each kind of card.

In this card game, Alice can trade cards with the three other players. Each player has different preferences for the $$$n$$$ types of cards, which can be described by permutations$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$q$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$j$$$ for the Queen, King, and Jack, respectively.

A player values card $$$a$$$ more than card $$$b$$$ if for their permutation $$$p$$$, $$$p_a > p_b$$$. Then, this player is willing to trade card $$$b$$$ to Alice in exchange for card $$$a$$$. Alice's preferences are straightforward: she values card $$$a$$$ more than card $$$b$$$ if $$$a > b$$$, and she will also only trade according to these preferences.

Determine if Alice can trade up from card $$$1$$$ to card $$$n$$$ subject to these preferences, and if it is possible, give a possible set of trades to do it.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of card types.

The next three lines contain the preferences of the Queen, King, and Jack respectively. Each of these lines contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1\le p_i\le n$$$) — a permutation corresponding to the player's preferences.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, on the first line output a single string "YES" or "NO" (without the quotes) denoting whether Alice can trade up to card $$$n$$$.

If the first line was "YES", then on the next line output $$$k$$$ — the number of trades Alice will make. On the next $$$k$$$ lines output space separated a character $$$c\in \{\texttt{q}, \texttt{k}, \texttt{j}\}$$$ and integer $$$x$$$, denoting that Alice trades with player $$$c$$$ to get card $$$x$$$. It must be the case that on the $$$k$$$'th line, $$$x = n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can output this answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses. The same goes for the character $$$c$$$ denoting the player in the trade ($$$\texttt{Q}, \texttt{K}, \texttt{J}$$$ will all be accepted alongside their lowercase variants).

The rabbit hole can be modeled as a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ which has an exit at vertex $$$1$$$, and Alice starts at some vertex $$$v$$$. She wants to get out of the hole, but unfortunately, the Queen of Hearts has ordered her execution.

Each minute, a fair coin is flipped. If it lands heads, Alice gets to move to an adjacent vertex of her current location, and otherwise, the Queen of Hearts gets to pull Alice to an adjacent vertex of the Queen's choosing. If Alice ever ends up on any of the non-root leaves$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of the tree, Alice loses.

Assuming both of them move optimally, compute the probability that Alice manages to escape for every single starting vertex $$$1\le v\le n$$$. Since these probabilities can be very small, output them modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Formally, let $$$M = 998\,244\,353$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$$$ and $$$x_i \neq y_i$$$) — the edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers on one line — the probabilities of Alice escaping starting from vertex $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$. Since these probabilities can be very small, output them modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

The Cheshire Cat has a riddle for Alice: given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and a target $$$m$$$, is there a way to insert $$$+$$$ and $$$\times$$$ into the circles of the expression $$$$$$a_1 \circ a_2 \circ \cdots \circ a_n = m$$$$$$ to make it true? We follow the usual order of operations: $$$\times$$$ is done before $$$+$$$.

Although Alice is excellent at chess, she is not good at math. Please help her so she can find a way out of Wonderland!

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1\le m\le 10^4$$$) — the number of integers and the target, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\le a_i\le 10^4$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output "YES" without quotes if it is possible to get the target by inserting $$$+$$$ or $$$\times$$$ and "NO" otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Two of Farmer John's cows, Bessie and Elsie, are planning to race on $$$n$$$ islands. There are $$$n - 1$$$ main bridges, connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$i + 1$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n - 1$$$. Additionally, there are $$$m$$$ alternative bridges. Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.

Initially, Elsie starts on island $$$1$$$, and Bessie starts on island $$$s$$$. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island $$$i$$$. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$j$$$, then the cow can move to island $$$j$$$. Then, island $$$i$$$ collapses, and all bridges connecting to island $$$i$$$ also collapse. Also, note the following:

- If there are no bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to another island, then island $$$i$$$ collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.
- If the other cow is also on island $$$i$$$, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.
- After an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.
- If a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.

The race ends once either cow reaches island $$$n$$$. It can be shown that regardless of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island $$$n$$$. Bessie wins if and only if she reaches island $$$n$$$ first.

For each $$$1 \leq s \leq n - 1$$$, determine whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island $$$s$$$. Assume both cows follow optimal strategies to ensure their own respective victories.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) – the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) – the number of islands and the number of alternative bridges.

The next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case contain $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u < v \leq n$$$) – the islands that the alternative bridge connects. It is guaranteed all alternative bridges are distinct, and they do not coincide with the main bridges.

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of $$$n$$$ nor the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases exceeds $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a binary string of length $$$n - 1$$$ on a new line. The $$$i$$$'th character is $$$1$$$ if it is possible for Bessie to win if she starts on island $$$i$$$. Otherwise, it is $$$0$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that $$$x=n$$$ in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.

You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$x=n$$$). There are $$$n$$$ balls lined up in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Initially, there is a value $$$a_i$$$ written on the $$$i$$$-th ball.

For each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we define a function $$$f(i)$$$ as follows:

- Suppose you have a set $$$S = \{1, 2, \ldots, i\}$$$.
- In each operation, you have to select an integer $$$l$$$ ($$$1 \leq l < i$$$) from $$$S$$$ such that $$$l$$$ is not the largest element of $$$S$$$. Suppose $$$r$$$ is the smallest element in $$$S$$$ which is greater than $$$l$$$.   If $$$a_l > a_r$$$, you set $$$a_l = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If $$$a_l < a_r$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If $$$a_l = a_r$$$, you choose either the integer $$$l$$$ or $$$r$$$ to remove from $$$S$$$:   If you choose to remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If you choose to remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$, you set $$$a_l = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$.
- $$$f(i)$$$ denotes the number of integers $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le i$$$) such that it is possible to obtain $$$S = \{j\}$$$ after performing the above operations exactly $$$i - 1$$$ times.

For each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$x$$$ to $$$n$$$, you need to find $$$f(i)$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5; x = n$$$) — the number of balls and the smallest index $$$i$$$ for which you need to find $$$f(i)$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial number written on each ball.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n-x+1$$$ space separated integers on a new line, where the $$$j$$$-th integer should represent $$$f(x+j-1)$$$.

There is a list of $$$n$$$ booleans, each of which is either true or false, given as a binary string $$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (where $$$\texttt{1}$$$ represents true, and $$$\texttt{0}$$$ represents false). Initially, there are no operators between the booleans.

Alice and Bob will take alternate turns placing and or or between the booleans, with Alice going first. Thus, the game will consist of $$$n-1$$$ turns since there are $$$n$$$ booleans. Alice aims for the final statement to evaluate to true, while Bob aims for it to evaluate to false. Given the list of boolean values, determine whether Alice will win if both players play optimally.

To evaluate the final expression, repeatedly perform the following steps until the statement consists of a single true or false:

- If the statement contains an and operator, choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding it with its evaluation.
- Otherwise, the statement contains an or operator. Choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding the or with its evaluation.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string.

The second line contains a binary string of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters $$$\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\texttt{1}$$$ — the list of boolean values.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each testcase, output "YES" (without quotes) if Alice wins, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq n$$$, $$$p$$$ is a permutation).

The following line contains $$$n$$$ characters $$$s_1s_2 \ldots s_n$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$s_i$$$ is either $$$\texttt{L}$$$ or $$$\texttt{R}$$$, $$$s_1 = \texttt{R}$$$, and $$$s_n = \texttt{L}$$$.

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \leq i \leq n-1$$$), denoting that $$$s_i$$$ is changed from $$$\texttt{L}$$$ to $$$\texttt{R}$$$ (or from $$$\texttt{R}$$$ to $$$\texttt{L}$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each query, output "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Suppose you have an array $$$b$$$. Initially, you also have a set $$$S$$$ that contains all distinct elements of $$$b$$$. The array $$$b$$$ is called orangutan-approved if it can be emptied by repeatedly performing the following operation:

- In one operation, select indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq |b|$$$) such that $$$v = b_l = b_{l+1} = \ldots = b_r$$$ and $$$v$$$ is present in $$$S$$$. Remove $$$v$$$ from $$$S$$$, and simultaneously remove all $$$b_i$$$ such that $$$l \leq i \leq r$$$. Then, reindex the elements $$$b_{r+1}, b_{r+2}, \ldots$$$ as $$$b_l, b_{l+1}, \ldots$$$ accordingly.

You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries.

Each query consists of two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$), and you need to determine whether or not the subarray $$$a_{l}, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$ is orangutan-approved.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n,q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of $$$a$$$ and the number of queries, respectively.

The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ — the endpoints of the subarray for each query ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each query, output "YES" (without quotes) if the subarray from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is orangutan-approved, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Orangutans are powerful beings—so powerful that they only need $$$1$$$ unit of time to destroy every vulnerable planet in the universe!

There are $$$n$$$ planets in the universe. Each planet has an interval of vulnerability $$$[l, r]$$$, during which it will be exposed to destruction by orangutans. Orangutans can also expand the interval of vulnerability of any planet by $$$1$$$ unit.

Given a set of planets, orangutans can destroy all planets if the intervals of vulnerability of all planets in the set intersect at least one common point. Let the score of such a set denote the minimum number of expansions that must be performed.

Misuki would choose one of the typewriters and use it to perform the following operations until $$$a$$$ becomes a permutation of $$$[1, 2, \ldots, n]$$$

- write number: write the minimum positive integer that isn't present in the array $$$a$$$ to the element $$$a_i$$$, $$$i$$$ is the position where the pointer points at. Such operation can be performed only when $$$a_i = -1$$$.
- carriage return: return the pointer to its initial position (i.e. $$$1$$$ for the first typewriter, $$$n$$$ for the second)
- move pointer: move the pointer to the next position, let $$$i$$$ be the position the pointer points at before this operation, if Misuki is using the first typewriter, $$$i := i + 1$$$ would happen, and $$$i := i - 1$$$ otherwise. Such operation can be performed only if after the operation, $$$1 \le i \le n$$$ holds.

Your task is to construct any permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, such that the minimum number of carriage return operations needed to make $$$a = p$$$ is the same no matter which typewriter Misuki is using.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a line of $$$n$$$ integers, representing the permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that the minimum number of carriage return operations needed to make $$$a = p$$$ is the same no matter which typewriter Misuki is using, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to do so.

If there are multiple valid permutations, you can output any of them.

Misuki has chosen a secret tree with $$$n$$$ nodes, indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and asked you to guess it by using queries of the following type:

- "? a b" — Misuki will tell you which node $$$x$$$ minimizes $$$|d(a,x) - d(b,x)|$$$, where $$$d(x,y)$$$ is the distance between nodes $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. If more than one such node exists, Misuki will tell you the one which minimizes $$$d(a,x)$$$.

Find out the structure of Misuki's secret tree using at most $$$15n$$$ queries!

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 200$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line with an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 1000$$$), the number of nodes in the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Let $$$S$$$ be the set of all possible non-empty subsequences of $$$a$$$ without duplicate elements. Your goal is to find the longest sequence in $$$S$$$. If there are multiple of them, find the one that minimizes lexicographical order after multiplying terms at odd positions by $$$-1$$$.

For example, given $$$a = [3, 2, 3, 1]$$$, $$$S = \{[1], [2], [3], [2, 1], [2, 3], [3, 1], [3, 2], [2, 3, 1], [3, 2, 1]\}$$$. Then $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$ and $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$ would be the longest, and $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$ would be the answer since $$$[-3, 2, -1]$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$[-2, 3, -1]$$$.

A sequence $$$c$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$d$$$ if $$$c$$$ can be obtained from $$$d$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

A sequence $$$c$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence $$$d$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:

- $$$c$$$ is a prefix of $$$d$$$, but $$$c \ne d$$$;
- in the first position where $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ differ, the sequence $$$c$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$d$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the answer in the following format:

Output an integer $$$m$$$ in the first line — the length of $$$b$$$.

Then output $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ in the second line — the sequence $$$b$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the two versions is the definition of deterministic max-heap, time limit, and constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Consider a perfect binary tree with size $$$2^n - 1$$$, with nodes numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n-1$$$ and rooted at $$$1$$$. For each vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), vertex $$$2v$$$ is its left child and vertex $$$2v + 1$$$ is its right child. Each node $$$v$$$ also has a value $$$a_v$$$ assigned to it.

Define the operation $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ as follows:

1. initialize variable $$$v$$$ as $$$1$$$;
2. repeat the following process until vertex $$$v$$$ is a leaf (i.e. until $$$2^{n - 1} \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$);   among the children of $$$v$$$, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as $$$x$$$; if the values on them are equal (i.e. $$$a_{2v} = a_{2v + 1}$$$), you can choose any of them;  assign $$$a_x$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := a_x$$$);  assign $$$x$$$ to $$$v$$$ (i.e. $$$v := x$$$);
3. assign $$$-1$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := -1$$$).

Then we say the $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, $$$a_{2v} \neq a_{2v + 1}$$$ would hold whenever choosing between them.

A binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), both $$$a_v \ge a_{2v}$$$ and $$$a_v \ge a_{2v + 1}$$$ hold.

A max-heap is deterministic if the $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first time.

Initially, $$$a_v := 0$$$ for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation $$$\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times:

- Choose an integer $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$) and, for every vertex $$$x$$$ on the path between $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$, add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_x$$$.

Two heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.

Since the answer might be large, print it modulo $$$p$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n, k, p$$$ ($$$1 \le n, k \le 500$$$, $$$10^8 \le p \le 10^9$$$, $$$p$$$ is a prime).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the aforementioned operation $$$\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times, modulo $$$p$$$.

It is guaranteed that there exists a permutation $$$p$$$ which generates the given graph. It is also guaranteed that the graph is undirected and has no self-loops, meaning $$$g_{i, j} = g_{j, i}$$$ and $$$g_{i, i} = \mathtt{0}$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ representing the reconstructed permutation.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: For an integer sequence $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]$$$, we define $$$f(a)$$$ as the length of the longest subsequence$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$a$$$ that is a palindrome$$$^{\text{†}}$$$.

Let $$$g(a)$$$ represent the number of subsequences of length $$$f(a)$$$ that are palindromes. In other words, $$$g(a)$$$ counts the number of palindromic subsequences in $$$a$$$ that have the maximum length.

Given an integer $$$n$$$, your task is to find any sequence $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers that satisfies the following conditions:

- $$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.
- $$$g(a) > n$$$

It can be proven that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$\color{red}{6} \le n \le 100$$$) — the length of the sequence.

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.

For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, representing an array that satisfies the conditions.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: A set $$$A$$$ consisting of pairwise distinct segments $$$[l, r]$$$ with integer endpoints is called good if $$$1\le l\le r\le n$$$, and for any pair of distinct segments $$$[l_i, r_i], [l_j, r_j]$$$ in $$$A$$$, exactly one of the following conditions holds:

- $$$r_i < l_j$$$ or $$$r_j < l_i$$$ (the segments do not intersect)
- $$$l_i \le l_j \le r_j \le r_i$$$ or $$$l_j \le l_i \le r_i \le r_j$$$ (one segment is fully contained within the other)

You are given a good set $$$S$$$ consisting of $$$m$$$ pairwise distinct segments $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ with integer endpoints. You want to add as many additional segments to the set $$$S$$$ as possible while ensuring that set $$$S$$$ remains good.

Since this task is too easy, you need to determine the number of different ways to add the maximum number of additional segments to $$$S$$$, ensuring that the set remains good. Two ways are considered different if there exists a segment that is being added in one of the ways, but not in the other.

Formally, you need to find the number of good sets $$$T$$$ of distinct segments, such that $$$S$$$ is a subset of $$$T$$$ and $$$T$$$ has the maximum possible size. Since the result might be very large, compute the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the maximum right endpoint of the segments, and the size of $$$S$$$.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$) — the boundaries of the segments in set $$$S$$$.

It is guaranteed that the given set $$$S$$$ is good, and the segments in set $$$S$$$ are pairwise distinct.

It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer representing the number of different ways, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$, that you can add the maximum number of additional segments to set $$$S$$$ while ensuring that set $$$S$$$ remains good.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, the constraints on $$$t$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$m$$$ are lower. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

A sequence $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers is called good if the following condition holds:

In other words, if both $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are present in sequence $$$a$$$, then the number of occurrences of $$$i$$$ in $$$a$$$ is less than or equal to the number of occurrences of $$$j$$$ in $$$a$$$.

You are given integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. Calculate the value of the bitwise XOR of the median$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of all good sequences $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ with $$$0\le a_i < m$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The only differences between the two versions are the constraints on $$$m$$$ and $$$q$$$. In this version, $$$m=2$$$ and $$$q=1$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Narek and Tsovak were busy preparing this round, so they have not managed to do their homework and decided to steal David's homework. Their strict teacher noticed that David has no homework and now wants to punish him. She hires other teachers to help her catch David. And now $$$m$$$ teachers together are chasing him. Luckily, the classroom is big, so David has many places to hide.

The classroom can be represented as a one-dimensional line with cells from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, inclusive.

At the start, all $$$m$$$ teachers and David are in distinct cells. Then they make moves. During each move

- David goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.
- Then, each of the $$$m$$$ teachers simultaneously goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.

This continues until David is caught. David is caught if any of the teachers (possibly more than one) is located in the same cell as David. Everyone sees others' moves, so they all act optimally.

Your task is to find how many moves it will take for the teachers to catch David if they all act optimally.

Acting optimally means the student makes his moves in a way that maximizes the number of moves the teachers need to catch him; and the teachers coordinate with each other to make their moves in a way that minimizes the number of moves they need to catch the student.

Also, as Narek and Tsovak think this task is easy, they decided to give you $$$q$$$ queries on David's position. Note: this is the easy version, and you are given only one query.

Input and Output Format:
In the first line of the input, you are given a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.

In the first line of each test case, you are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^9$$$, $$$m=2$$$, $$$q=1$$$) — the number of cells on the line, the number of teachers, and the number of queries.

In the second line of each test case, you are given $$$m$$$ distinct integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le n$$$) — the cell numbers of the teachers.

In the third line of each test case, you are given $$$q$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_q$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — David's cell number for every query.

It is guaranteed that for any $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le m$$$ and $$$1 \le j \le q$$$, $$$b_i \neq a_j$$$.

For each test case, output $$$q$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of them containing the answer of the $$$i$$$-th query.

<user>: system: 

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Narek is too lazy to create the third problem of this contest. His friend Artur suggests that he should use ChatGPT. ChatGPT creates $$$n$$$ problems, each consisting of $$$m$$$ letters, so Narek has $$$n$$$ strings. To make the problem harder, he combines the problems by selecting some of the $$$n$$$ strings possibly none and concatenating them without altering their order. His chance of solving the problem is defined as $$$score_n - score_c$$$, where $$$score_n$$$ is Narek's score and $$$score_c$$$ is ChatGPT's score.

Narek calculates $$$score_n$$$ by examining the selected string (he moves from left to right). He initially searches for the letter $$$\texttt{"n"}$$$, followed by $$$\texttt{"a"}$$$, $$$\texttt{"r"}$$$, $$$\texttt{"e"}$$$, and $$$\texttt{"k"}$$$. Upon finding all occurrences of these letters, he increments $$$score_n$$$ by $$$5$$$ and resumes searching for $$$\texttt{"n"}$$$ again (he doesn't go back, and he just continues from where he left off).

After Narek finishes, ChatGPT scans through the array and increments $$$score_c$$$ by $$$1$$$ for each letter $$$\texttt{"n"}$$$, $$$\texttt{"a"}$$$, $$$\texttt{"r"}$$$, $$$\texttt{"e"}$$$, or $$$\texttt{"k"}$$$ that Narek fails to utilize (note that if Narek fails to complete the last occurrence by finding all of the $$$5$$$ letters, then all of the letters he used are counted in ChatGPT's score $$$score_c$$$, and Narek doesn't get any points if he doesn't finish finding all the 5 letters).

Narek aims to maximize the value of $$$score_n - score_c$$$ by selecting the most optimal subset of the initial strings.

Input and Output Format:
In the first line of the input, you're given a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$), the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows.

In the first line of each test case, you're given two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 10^3$$$), the number of strings and the length of each string.

In the next $$$n$$$ lines, you're given $$$n$$$ strings, each having a length of $$$m$$$. The strings only contain lowercase letters of the English alphabet.

The sum of values of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximal possible value of $$$score_n - score_c$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The differences between the two versions are the constraints on all the variables. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Tsovak and Narek are playing a game. They have an array $$$a$$$ and a matrix $$$b$$$ of integers with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, numbered from $$$1$$$. The cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$(i, j)$$$.

They are looking for the elements of $$$a$$$ in turns; Tsovak starts first. Each time a player looks for a cell in the matrix containing the current element of $$$a$$$ (Tsovak looks for the first, then Narek looks for the second, etc.). Let's say a player has chosen the cell $$$(r, c)$$$. The next player has to choose his cell in the submatrix starting at $$$(r + 1, c + 1)$$$ and ending in $$$(n, m)$$$ (the submatrix can be empty if $$$r=n$$$ or $$$c=m$$$). If a player cannot find such a cell (or the remaining submatrix is empty) or the array ends (the previous player has chosen the last element), then he loses.

Your task is to determine the winner if the players play optimally.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 300$$$) – the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$l$$$, $$$n$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le l, n, m \le 300$$$) – the size of the array and the sizes of the matrix.

The second line contains $$$l$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots a_l$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le \min(7, n \cdot m)$$$) – the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

The $$$i$$$-th of the last $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}, b_{i,3}, \ldots b_{i,m}$$$ ($$$1 \le b_{i,j} \le \min(7, n \cdot m)$$$) – representing the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$l$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$300$$$.

You should output $$$t$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of them containing a character representing the answer of the $$$i$$$-th test case: "T" if Tsovak wins or "N", otherwise (without quotes).

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. The differences between the two versions are the constraints on all the variables. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Tsovak and Narek are playing a game. They have an array $$$a$$$ and a matrix $$$b$$$ of integers with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, numbered from $$$1$$$. The cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$(i, j)$$$.

They are looking for the elements of $$$a$$$ in turns; Tsovak starts first. Each time a player looks for a cell in the matrix containing the current element of $$$a$$$ (Tsovak looks for the first, then Narek looks for the second, etc.). Let's say a player has chosen the cell $$$(r, c)$$$. The next player has to choose his cell in the submatrix starting at $$$(r + 1, c + 1)$$$ and ending in $$$(n, m)$$$ (the submatrix can be empty if $$$r=n$$$ or $$$c=m$$$). If a player cannot find such a cell (or the remaining submatrix is empty) or the array ends (the previous player has chosen the last element), then he loses.

Your task is to determine the winner if the players play optimally.

Note: since the input is large, you may need to optimize input/output for this problem.

For example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:

However, to prevent theft and ensure the safety of his wealth, King Keykhosrow's vault was sealed with a magical lock that could only be opened by solving a riddle.

The riddle involves two sacred numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. To unlock the vault, the challenger must determine the smallest key number $$$m$$$ that satisfies two conditions:

- $$$m$$$ must be greater than or equal to at least one of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.
- The remainder when $$$m$$$ is divided by $$$a$$$ must be equal to the remainder when $$$m$$$ is divided by $$$b$$$.

Only by finding the smallest correct value of $$$m$$$ can one unlock the vault and access the legendary treasures!

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$), the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \leq a, b \leq 1000$$$).

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Rostam's loyal horse, Rakhsh, has seen better days. Once powerful and fast, Rakhsh has grown weaker over time, struggling to even move. Rostam worries that if too many parts of Rakhsh's body lose strength at once, Rakhsh might stop entirely. To keep his companion going, Rostam decides to strengthen Rakhsh, bit by bit, so no part of his body is too frail for too long.

Imagine Rakhsh's body as a line of spots represented by a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where each $$$0$$$ means a weak spot and each $$$1$$$ means a strong one. Rostam's goal is to make sure that no interval of $$$m$$$ consecutive spots is entirely weak (all $$$0$$$s).

Luckily, Rostam has a special ability called Timar, inherited from his mother Rudabeh at birth. With Timar, he can select any segment of length $$$k$$$ and instantly strengthen all of it (changing every character in that segment to $$$1$$$). The challenge is to figure out the minimum number of times Rostam needs to use Timar to keep Rakhsh moving, ensuring there are no consecutive entirely weak spots of length $$$m$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$), the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three numbers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le m, k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters $$$s_1s_2 \ldots s_n$$$. ($$$s_i \in \{$$$0,1$$$\}$$$ for $$$1 \le i \le n$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the minimum number of times Rostam needs to use Timar to keep Rakhsh moving, ensuring there are no consecutive entirely weak spots of length $$$m$$$.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: In the fourth labor of Rostam, the legendary hero from the Shahnameh, an old witch has created a magical maze to trap him. The maze is a rectangular grid consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Each cell in the maze points in a specific direction: up, down, left, or right. The witch has enchanted Rostam so that whenever he is in a cell, he will move to the next cell in the direction indicated by that cell.

If Rostam eventually exits the maze, he will be freed from the witch's enchantment and will defeat her. However, if he remains trapped within the maze forever, he will never escape.

The witch has not yet determined the directions for all the cells. She wants to assign directions to the unspecified cells in such a way that the number of starting cells from which Rostam will be trapped forever is maximized. Your task is to find the maximum number of starting cells which make Rostam trapped.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$), the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a string of $$$m$$$ characters representing the directions in the maze. Each character is one of the following:   U (up)  D (down)  L (left)  R (right)  ? (unspecified direction)

It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases is at most $$$10^6$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Darius the Great is constructing $$$n$$$ stone columns, each consisting of a base and between $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, or $$$2$$$ inscription pieces stacked on top.

In each move, Darius can choose two columns $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ such that the difference in the number of inscriptions between these columns is exactly $$$1$$$, and transfer one inscription from the column with more inscriptions to the other one. It is guaranteed that at least one column contains exactly $$$1$$$ inscription.

Since beauty is the main pillar of historical buildings, Darius wants the columns to have ascending heights. To avoid excessive workers' efforts, he asks you to plan a sequence of at most $$$n$$$ moves to arrange the columns in non-decreasing order based on the number of inscriptions. Minimizing the number of moves is not required.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ — the number of test cases. ($$$1 \leq t \leq 3000$$$)

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ — the number of stone columns. ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$)

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i \in \{0,1,2\}$$$ represents the initial number of inscriptions in the $$$i$$$-th column. It is guaranteed that at least one column has exactly $$$1$$$ inscription.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output an integer $$$k$$$ — the number of moves used to sort the columns. ($$$0 \leq k \leq n$$$)

Then, output $$$k$$$ lines, each containing two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$$$), representing the indices of the columns involved in the $$$i$$$-th move. During each move, it must hold that $$$|a_{u_i} - a_{v_i}| = 1$$$, and one inscription is transferred from the column with more inscriptions to the other.

It can be proven that a valid solution always exists under the given constraints.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Rayan wants to present a gift to Reyhaneh to win her heart. However, Reyhaneh is particular and will only accept a k-harmonic set of permutations.

We define a k-harmonic set of permutations as a set of $$$k$$$ pairwise distinct permutations $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$$$ of size $$$n$$$ such that for every pair of indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ (where $$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$), the following condition holds:

$$$$$$ p_1[i] + p_2[i] + \ldots + p_k[i] = p_1[j] + p_2[j] + \ldots + p_k[j] $$$$$$

Your task is to help Rayan by either providing a valid k-harmonic set of permutations for given values of $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ or by determining that such a set does not exist.

We call a sequence of length $$$n$$$ a permutation if it contains every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$), the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5$$$). The sum of $$$n \cdot k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, if a k-harmonic set of permutations exists, print YES on the first line. Then, print $$$k$$$ lines, each containing a distinct permutation of the integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

If no such set exists, print NO on the first line.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

In ancient Persia, Khayyam, a clever merchant and mathematician, is playing a game with his prized treasure chest containing $$$n$$$ red rubies worth $$$2$$$ dinars each and $$$m$$$ blue sapphires worth $$$1$$$ dinar each. He also has a satchel, which starts empty, and $$$k$$$ scrolls with pairs $$$(r_1, b_1), (r_2, b_2), \ldots, (r_k, b_k)$$$ that describe special conditions.

The game proceeds for $$$n + m$$$ turns as follows:

1. Khayyam draws a gem uniformly at random from the chest.
2. He removes the gem from the chest and places it in his satchel.
3. If there exists a scroll $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq k$$$) such that the chest contains exactly $$$r_i$$$ red rubies and $$$b_i$$$ blue sapphires, Khayyam receives a royal decree that doubles the value of all the gems in his satchel as a reward for achieving a special configuration.

Note that the value of some gems might be affected by multiple decrees, and in that case the gems' value is doubled multiple times.

Determine the expected value of Khayyam's satchel at the end of the game, modulo $$$998,244,353$$$.

Formally, let $$$M = 998,244,353$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq k \leq 500$$$) — the number of red rubies, the number of blue sapphires, and the number of scrolls describing special conditions, respectively.

Each of the next $$$k$$$ lines contains two integers $$$r_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq r_i \leq n$$$, $$$0 \leq b_i \leq m$$$, $$$1 \leq r_i + b_i \leq n+m-1$$$). It is guaranteed that the pairs $$$(r_i, b_i)$$$ are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer: the expected value of Khayyam's satchel at the end of the process, modulo $$$998,244,353$$$.

The legendary Simurgh, a mythical bird, is responsible for keeping watch over vast lands, and for this purpose, she has enlisted $$$n$$$ vigilant warriors. Each warrior is alert during a specific time segment $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$, where $$$l_i$$$ is the start time (included) and $$$r_i$$$ is the end time (included), both positive integers.

One of Simurgh's trusted advisors, Zal, is concerned that if multiple warriors are stationed at the same time and all wear the same color, the distinction between them might be lost, causing confusion in the watch. To prevent this, whenever multiple warriors are on guard at the same moment (which can be non-integer), there must be at least one color which is worn by exactly one warrior.

So the task is to determine the minimum number of colors required and assign a color $$$c_i$$$ to each warrior's segment $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ such that, for every (real) time $$$t$$$ contained in at least one segment, there exists one color which belongs to exactly one segment containing $$$t$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of warriors stationed by Simurgh.
- The next $$$n$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the start and end times of the warrior's watch segment.

The sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case:

- Output the minimum number of colors $$$k$$$ needed.
- Then, output a line of $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq c_i \leq k$$$), where each $$$c_i$$$ is the color assigned to the $$$i$$$-th warrior.

To test this, Reyhaneh asks Khwarizmi for help. Khwarizmi explains that a set is integer linearly independent if no element in the set can be written as an integer linear combination of the others. Rayan is given a set of integers each time and must identify one of the largest possible integer linearly independent subsets.

Note that a single element is always considered an integer linearly independent subset.

An integer linearly combination of $$$a_1, \ldots, a_k$$$ is any sum of the form $$$c_1 \cdot a_1 + c_2 \cdot a_2 + \ldots + c_k \cdot a_k$$$ where $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$$$ are integers (which may be zero, positive, or negative).

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^6$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: There is a team of $$$n$$$ software engineers numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Their boss promises to give them a bonus if they complete an additional project. The project requires $$$k$$$ units of work in total. The bonus promised to the $$$i$$$-th engineer is $$$a_i$$$ burles. The boss doesn't assign specific tasks to engineers; it is expected that every engineer will voluntarily complete some integer amount of work units. The bonus will be paid to the entire team only if the project is completed; in other words, if the total amount of voluntary work units on the project is greater than or equal to $$$k$$$.

The amount of work that can be performed by each engineer is not limited. However, all engineers value their labour. The $$$i$$$-th engineer estimates one unit of their work as $$$b_i$$$ burles. If the bonus is paid, the benefit $$$s_i$$$ of the $$$i$$$-th engineer for completing $$$c$$$ units of work is defined as $$$s_i = a_i - c \cdot b_i$$$. If the bonus is not paid, the engineer will not volunteer to do any work.

Engineers work together for many years, so they know how the bonus is going to be distributed and how much their colleagues value the labour. That is, all $$$a_i$$$ and all $$$b_i$$$ are known to every engineer in the team.

Engineers are eager to get the bonus, so they agreed on the following process of work distribution between them:

- the first engineer says: "I will complete $$$c_1$$$ units of work", where $$$c_1$$$ is a non-negative integer;
- then, the second engineer says: "I will complete $$$c_2$$$ units of work", where $$$c_2$$$ is a non-negative integer;
- ... and so on;
- finally, the $$$n$$$-th engineer says: "I will complete $$$c_n$$$ units of work", where $$$c_n$$$ is a non-negative integer.

Every engineer voices $$$c_i$$$ in a way to maximize their own benefit $$$s_i$$$. If the expected benefit is going to be zero, an engineer will still agree to work to get the experience and to help their colleagues obtain the bonus. However, if the benefit is expected to be negative for some reason (an engineer needs to perform an excessive amount of work or the project is not going to be completed), that engineer will not work at all (completes zero amount of work units).

Given that every engineer acts perfectly, your task is to find out the numbers $$$c_i$$$ voiced by every engineer.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 10^6$$$) — the number of engineers in the company and the number of work units the project requires, respectively.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. The elements of the array are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose an index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$; decrease $$$a_i$$$ by $$$2$$$ and increase $$$a_{(i \bmod n) + 1}$$$ by $$$1$$$.

After you perform the operations, all elements of the array should be non-negative equal integers.

Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform.

Input and Output Format:

You need to pick $$$8$$$ elements from the list and use them as coordinates of four points. These four points should be corners of a rectangle which has its sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Your task is to pick coordinates in such a way that the resulting rectangle has the maximum possible area. The rectangle can be degenerate, i. e. its area can be $$$0$$$. Each integer can be used as many times as it occurs in the list (or less).

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 25\,000$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$8 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

- if it is impossible to construct a rectangle which meets the constraints from the statement, print a single line containing the word NO (case-insensitive);
- otherwise, in the first line, print YES (case-insensitive). In the second line, print $$$8$$$ integers $$$x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4$$$ — the coordinates of the corners of the rectangle. You can print the corners in any order.

You have to split this array into several segments (possibly one) in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one segment.

Let the first segment be the array $$$[a_{l_1}, a_{l_1 + 1}, \ldots, a_{r_1}]$$$, the second segment be $$$[a_{l_2}, a_{l_2+ 1}, \ldots, a_{r_2}]$$$, ..., the last segment be $$$[a_{l_k}, a_{l_k+ 1}, \ldots, a_{r_k}]$$$. Since every element should belong to exactly one array, $$$l_1 = 1$$$, $$$r_k = n$$$, and $$$r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k-1$$$. The split should meet the following condition: $$$f([a_{l_1}, a_{l_1 + 1}, \ldots, a_{r_1}]) \le f([a_{l_2}, a_{l_2+ 1}, \ldots, a_{r_2}]) \le \dots \le f([a_{l_k}, a_{l_k+1}, \ldots, a_{r_k}])$$$, where $$$f(a)$$$ is the bitwise OR of all elements of the array $$$a$$$.

Calculate the number of ways to split the array, and print it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$. Two ways are considered different if the sequences $$$[l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, \ldots, l_k, r_k]$$$ denoting the splits are different.

All barrels are equal and have a bottom area equal to one unit, so the volume of the water inside a barrel is equal to the height of the water column. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th barrel has $$$v_i$$$ units of water.

Adjacent barrels are connected by pipes. In other words, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, barrels $$$i$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$ are connected by a single horizontal pipe at height $$$h_i$$$. The widths of the pipes are negligible. These pipes allow water to flow between barrels.

Now you want to play with barrels. Your plan is to maximize the volume of the water in the first barrel by throwing clay into barrels. In one step, you can choose any barrel and throw one unit of clay into it. One unit of clay has the same volume as one unit of water. Clay is heavier than water and doesn't mix with it, so it falls to the bottom of the barrel, distributing evenly.

Clay has a sticky structure, so it seals pipes if the clay column is high enough. More formally, suppose the pipe is at height $$$h$$$. If the height of the clay column is also $$$\boldsymbol{h}$$$ (or lower), the pipe is working. But the moment you add more clay into the barrel, the pipe becomes sealed instantly, preventing any water from moving between barrels.

You have a mountain of clay, so you can repeat the step described above any number of times. However, between the steps, you have to wait until the water reaches the new equilibrium.

What is the maximum water volume you can collect in the first barrel?

Assume that the barrels are high enough, so the water doesn't overflow, and the pipe widths are negligible.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of barrels.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$$$ ($$$0 \le v_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$v_i$$$ is the initial water volume in the $$$i$$$-th barrel.

The third line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_{n - 1}$$$ ($$$1 \le h_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the height of the pipe between the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$(i + 1)$$$-st barrel.

Additional constraint on the input: the given water heights are in an equilibrium.

Print a single number — the maximum volume of water in the first barrel. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.

Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Suppose you are working in the Ministry of Digital Development of Berland, and your task is to monitor the industry of video blogging.

There are $$$n$$$ bloggers in Berland. Recently, due to the poor state of the main video platform in Berland, two alternative platforms were introduced. That's why bloggers started to reupload their videos to these alternative platforms. You've got the statistics that the $$$i$$$-th blogger uploaded $$$v_i$$$ videos to the first alternative platform and $$$r_i$$$ videos to the second alternative platform.

You think that a potential user will be upset if even at least one of his favorite bloggers doesn't upload anything. However, if a blogger uploads videos to both platforms, the user will watch that blogger on the platform where more videos are available. So, you've come up with the following function to estimate user experience. Suppose a user watches $$$k$$$ bloggers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k$$$; then, let user experience be $$$$$$E(b_1, \dots, b_k) = \max\left(\min_{i=1..k}{v[b_i]}, \min_{i=1..k}{r[b_i]}\right).$$$$$$

In order to get some statistics, you want to calculate the value $$$\mathit{avg}_k$$$ that is equal to an average experience among all subsets of bloggers of size $$$k$$$. Also, you have to calculate $$$\mathit{avg}_k$$$ for each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

Since answers may be too large, print them modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of bloggers.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$$$ ($$$0 \le v_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$v_i$$$ is the number of videos of the $$$i$$$-th blogger on the first alternative platform.

The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n$$$ ($$$0 \le r_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$r_i$$$ is the number of videos of the $$$i$$$-th blogger on the second alternative platform.

Print $$$n$$$ integers $$$\mathit{avg}_1, \mathit{avg}_2, \dots, \mathit{avg}_n$$$.

It can be proven that $$$\mathit{avg}_k$$$ may be represented as an irreducible fraction $$$\dfrac{x}{y}$$$ where $$$y \not\equiv 0 \pmod{998\,244\,353}$$$. So, print $$$\mathit{avg}_k$$$ in a form $$$x \cdot y^{-1} \bmod 998\,244\,353$$$.

The empire is governed by $$$n$$$ political parties. Initially, every party has political power equal to $$$0$$$, and there is no ruling party.

During each of the next $$$m$$$ turns, the following happens:

1. initially, Monocarp has to choose which party he supports. He can support any party, except for the ruling party. When Monocarp supports a party, its political power is increased by $$$1$$$. If Monocarp supports the $$$i$$$-th party during the $$$j$$$-th turn, his score increases by $$$a_{i,j}$$$ points;
2. then, the elections happen, and the party with the maximum political power is chosen as the ruling party (if there are multiple such parties, the party with the lowest index among them is chosen). The former ruling party is replaced, unless it is chosen again;
3. finally, an event happens. At the end of the $$$j$$$-th turn, the party $$$p_j$$$ must be the ruling party to prevent a bad outcome of the event, otherwise Monocarp loses the game.

Determine which party Monocarp has to support during each turn so that he doesn't lose the game due to the events, and the score he achieves is the maximum possible. Initially, Monocarp's score is $$$0$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 50$$$) — the number of political parties and the number of turns, respectively.

Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \dots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{i,j} \le 10^5$$$), where $$$a_{i,j}$$$ is the amount of points Monocarp gets if he supports the $$$i$$$-th party during the $$$j$$$-th turn.

If Monocarp loses the game no matter how he acts, print one integer $$$-1$$$.

Otherwise, print $$$m$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m$$$ ($$$1 \le c_j \le n$$$), where $$$c_j$$$ is the index of the party Monocarp should support during the $$$j$$$-th turn. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Berland is this year's host country of the International Collegiate Polyathlon Competition! Similar to biathlon being a competition of two sports, polyathlon is a competition of many sports. This year, there are $$$m$$$ sports. Also, there are $$$n$$$ participants in the event. The sports are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, and the participants are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

Some participants are skilled in multiple sports. You are given a binary matrix $$$n \times m$$$ such that the $$$j$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th row is 1 if the $$$i$$$-th participant is skilled in the $$$j$$$-th sport, and 0, otherwise. It's also known that, for each pair of participants, there exists at least one sport such that one of them is skilled in that sport and the other one isn't.

The order of sports in the competition is determined at the opening ceremony. Historically, it's done by the almighty Random Number Generator. A random number $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ is rolled. The competition then starts with the sport $$$x$$$, then the sport $$$(x \bmod m + 1)$$$ is played, then the sport $$$((x + 1) \bmod m + 1)$$$, and so on.

Each sport is played as follows. If all remaining participants (all participants which are not eliminated yet) are not skilled in that sport, everyone goes through to the next sport. Otherwise, all skilled participants go through to the next sport, and all unskilled participants are eliminated from the competition. Once there is a single participant remaining in the competition, the competition ends, and that participant is declared the winner.

As an organizer of the competition, you are curious of the possible outcomes of the competition beforehand (not that you are going to rig the random roll, how could you possibly think that...). For each sport $$$x$$$, print the index of the winner if the competition starts with the sport $$$x$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 10^6$$$; $$$n \le 2^m$$$; $$$nm \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the number of participants and the number of sports, respectively.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a binary string consisting of exactly $$$m$$$ characters 0 or 1 — the skillset of the $$$i$$$-th participant. If the $$$j$$$-th character is 1, the $$$i$$$-th participant is skilled in the $$$j$$$-th sport. If it's 0, the $$$i$$$-th participant is not skilled in the $$$j$$$-th sport.

Additional constraint on the input: for each pair of participants, there exists at least one sport such that one of them is skilled in that sport and the other one isn't. In other words, all $$$n$$$ binary strings are pairwise distinct.

Print $$$m$$$ integers. For each $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, print the index of the winner if the competition starts with the sport $$$x$$$.

You are given a list of events of two types:

- B $$$b_i$$$ — a bus with $$$b_i$$$ free seats arrives at the stop;
- P $$$p_i$$$ — $$$p_i$$$ people arrive at the stop.

These events are listed in a chronological order.

When a bus arrives, the following happens. All people at the bus stop (except for Monocarp) try to enter the bus. If there are enough free seats for all of them, then they all enter the bus. Otherwise, some people remain at the bus stop (the number of people who enter the bus is equal to the number of free seats).

If there is still at least one free seat after all people (except for Monocarp) enter the bus, then Monocarp can decide to enter this bus as well (but he might choose to wait for another bus). For each bus, you have to determine if it is possible for Monocarp to take that bus.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 10^3)$$$ — the number of events.

Then, $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains the description of the $$$i$$$-th event in one of the two following formats:

- B $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 10^6$$$) — a bus with $$$b_i$$$ free seats arrives at the stop;
- P $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le 10^6$$$) — $$$p_i$$$ people arrive at the stop.

Additional constraint on the input: there is at least one event of type B.

For each event of type B, print YES if it is possible for Monocarp to take the corresponding bus, or NO otherwise (case-insensitive).

Both the rows and the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let's denote the cell at the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column as $$$(i, j)$$$.

You are standing in the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ and want to move into the cell $$$(n, n)$$$.

Suppose you are in the cell $$$(i, j)$$$; in one step, you can move either into the cell $$$(i, j + 1)$$$ or into the cell $$$(i + 1, j)$$$ if the corresponding cells exist.

Let's define the cost of the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ as $$$c(i, j) = \gcd(i, a) + \gcd(j, b)$$$ (here, $$$\gcd(x,y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$). The cost of the route from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, n)$$$ is the sum of costs of the visited cells (including the starting cell and the finishing cell).

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Recently, Monocarp started working as a director of a park located near his house. The park is quite large, so it even has a small river splitting it into several zones. Several bridges are built across this river. Three of these bridges are especially old and need to be repaired.

All three bridges have the same length but differ in width. Their widths are $$$18$$$, $$$21$$$ and $$$25$$$ units, respectively.

During the park renovation process, Monocarp has to replace the old planks that served as the surface of the bridges with the new ones.

Planks are sold with a standard length of $$$60$$$ units. Monocarp already knows that he needs $$$n$$$ planks for each bridge. But since the bridges have different widths, he needs $$$n$$$ planks of length $$$18$$$ for the first bridge, $$$n$$$ planks of length $$$21$$$ for the second one, and $$$n$$$ planks of length $$$25$$$ for the last one.

Workers in charge of renovation have no problem with cutting planks into parts but refuse to join planks, since it creates weak spots and looks ugly.

Monocarp wants to buy as few planks as possible but struggles to calculate the required number of planks. Can you help him?

Input and Output Format:
The first and only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$) — the number of planks required for each of the three bridges.

Print a single integer — the minimum number of planks of standard length ($$$60$$$ units) Monocarp needs to cover all three bridges if the planks can be cut into parts.

There is a deck, which consists of cards of $$$n$$$ different suits. For each suit, there are $$$13$$$ cards in the deck, all with different ranks (the ranks are $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, ..., $$$10$$$, Jack, Queen, King and Ace).

Initially, the deck is shuffled randomly (all $$$(13n)!$$$ possible orders of cards have the same probability). You draw $$$5$$$ topmost cards from the deck. Then, every turn of the game, the following events happen, in the given order:

1. if the cards in your hand form a Royal Flush (a $$$10$$$, a Jack, a Queen, a King, and an Ace, all of the same suit), you win, and the game ends;
2. if you haven't won yet, and the deck is empty, you lose, and the game ends;
3. if the game hasn't ended yet, you may choose any cards from your hand (possibly, all of them) and discard them. When a card is discarded, it is removed from the game;
4. finally, you draw cards from the deck, until you have $$$5$$$ cards or the deck becomes empty.

Your goal is to find a strategy that allows you to win in the minimum expected number of turns. Note that the turn when the game ends is not counted (for example, if the $$$5$$$ cards you draw initially already form a Royal Flush, you win in $$$0$$$ turns).

Calculate the minimum possible expected number of turns required to win the game.

Input and Output Format:
The only line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 4$$$) — the number of suits used in the game.

Print the minimum expected number of turns.

Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer will be accepted if and only if $$$\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$$$.

For each chest, you can choose any non-negative ($$$0$$$ or greater) number of coins to add to that chest, with one constraint: the total number of coins in all chests must become at least $$$k$$$.

After you've finished adding coins to the chests, greedy Monocarp comes, who wants the coins. He will take the chests one by one, and since he is greedy, he will always choose the chest with the maximum number of coins. Monocarp will stop as soon as the total number of coins in chests he takes is at least $$$k$$$.

You want Monocarp to take as few coins as possible, so you have to add coins to the chests in such a way that, when Monocarp stops taking chests, he will have exactly $$$k$$$ coins. Calculate the minimum number of coins you have to add.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

- the first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 50$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 10^7$$$);
- the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le k$$$).

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to add so that, when Monocarp stops taking the chests, he has exactly $$$k$$$ coins. It can be shown that under the constraints of the problem, it is always possible.

There are $$$n$$$ marbles, the $$$i$$$-th of them has color $$$c_i$$$. The players take turns; Alice goes first, then Bob, then Alice again, then Bob again, and so on.

During their turn, a player must take one of the remaining marbles and remove it from the game. If there are no marbles left (all $$$n$$$ marbles have been taken), the game ends.

Alice's score at the end of the game is calculated as follows:

- she receives $$$1$$$ point for every color $$$x$$$ such that she has taken at least one marble of that color;
- additionally, she receives $$$1$$$ point for every color $$$x$$$ such that she has taken all marbles of that color (of course, only colors present in the game are considered).

For example, suppose there are $$$5$$$ marbles, their colors are $$$[1, 3, 1, 3, 4]$$$, and the game goes as follows: Alice takes the $$$1$$$-st marble, then Bob takes the $$$3$$$-rd marble, then Alice takes the $$$5$$$-th marble, then Bob takes the $$$2$$$-nd marble, and finally, Alice takes the $$$4$$$-th marble. Then, Alice receives $$$4$$$ points: $$$3$$$ points for having at least one marble for colors $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, and $$$1$$$ point for having all marbles of color $$$4$$$. Note that this strategy is not necessarily optimal for both players.

Alice wants to maximize her score at the end of the game. Bob wants to minimize it. Both players play optimally (i. e. Alice chooses a strategy which allows her to get as many points as possible, and Bob chooses a strategy which minimizes the amount of points Alice can get).

Calculate Alice's score at the end of the game.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

- the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$) — the number of marbles;
- the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le n$$$) — the colors of the marbles.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.

For each test case, print one integer — Alice's score at the end of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.

In total, they caught $$$n$$$ fishes, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (the bigger the fish, the greater its index). Some of these fishes were caught by Alice, others — by Bob.

Their performance will be evaluated as follows. First, an integer $$$m$$$ will be chosen, and all fish will be split into $$$m$$$ non-empty groups. The first group should contain several (at least one) smallest fishes, the second group — several (at least one) next smallest fishes, and so on. Each fish should belong to exactly one group, and each group should be a contiguous subsegment of fishes. Note that the groups are numbered in exactly that order; for example, the fishes from the second group cannot be smaller than the fishes from the first group, since the first group contains the smallest fishes.

Then, each fish will be assigned a value according to its group index: each fish in the first group gets value equal to $$$0$$$, each fish in the second group gets value equal to $$$1$$$, and so on. So, each fish in the $$$i$$$-th group gets value equal to $$$(i-1)$$$.

The score of each contestant is simply the total value of all fishes that contestant caught.

You want Bob's score to exceed Alice's score by at least $$$k$$$ points. What is the minimum number of groups ($$$m$$$) you have to split the fishes into? If it is impossible, you should report that.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 10^9$$$).

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ characters. The $$$i$$$-th character is either 0 (denoting that the $$$i$$$-th fish was caught by Alice) or 1 (denoting that the $$$i$$$-th fish was caught by Bob).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of groups you have to split the fishes into; or -1 if it's impossible.

The service has $$$n$$$ active users and $$$10^9$$$ tracks users can listen to. Users can like tracks and, based on likes, the service should recommend them new tracks.

Tracks are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^9$$$. It turned out that tracks the $$$i$$$-th user likes form a segment $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$.

Let's say that the user $$$j$$$ is a predictor for user $$$i$$$ ($$$j \neq i$$$) if user $$$j$$$ likes all tracks the $$$i$$$-th user likes (and, possibly, some other tracks too).

Also, let's say that a track is strongly recommended for user $$$i$$$ if the track is not liked by the $$$i$$$-th user yet, but it is liked by every predictor for the $$$i$$$-th user.

Calculate the number of strongly recommended tracks for each user $$$i$$$. If a user doesn't have any predictors, then print $$$0$$$ for that user.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given a tree consisting of $$$2n$$$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. Each vertex has an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ written on it. Each value from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is written on exactly two different vertices. Each vertex also has a cost —vertex $$$i$$$ costs $$$2^i$$$.

You need to choose a subset of vertices of the tree such that:

- the subset is connected; that is, from each vertex in the subset, you can reach every other vertex in the subset by passing only through the vertices in the subset;
- each value from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is written on at least one vertex in the subset.

Among all such subsets, you need to find the one with the smallest total cost of the vertices in it. Note that you are not required to minimize the number of vertices in the subset.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$). Each value from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly twice.

Each of the next $$$2n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le v, u \le 2n$$$) — the edges of the tree. These edges form a valid tree.

In the first line, print a single integer $$$k$$$ — the number of vertices in the subset.

In the second line, print $$$k$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ — the indices of the vertices in the chosen subset. The vertices can be printed in an arbitrary order.

She is currently at point $$$(0,0)$$$ and wants to go to point $$$(x,y)$$$. In one move, she chooses an integer $$$d$$$ such that $$$0 \leq d \leq k$$$ and jumps $$$d$$$ spots forward in the direction she is facing.

Initially, she is facing the positive $$$x$$$ direction. After every move, she will alternate between facing the positive $$$x$$$ direction and the positive $$$y$$$ direction (i.e., she will face the positive $$$y$$$ direction on her second move, the positive $$$x$$$ direction on her third move, and so on).

What is the minimum amount of moves she must perform to land on point $$$(x,y)$$$?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9, 1 \leq k \leq 10^9$$$).

For each test case, output the number of jumps Freya needs to make on a new line.

Then, she asks you $$$q$$$ queries. For each query, output the sum of all elements in the subarray of $$$b$$$ that starts from the $$$l$$$-th element and ends at the $$$r$$$-th element, inclusive of both ends.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries.

The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6$$$).

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n^2$$$) — the left and right bounds of the query.

Note that the large inputs may require the use of 64-bit integers.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the extreme version of the problem. In this version, the output of each query is different from the easy and hard versions. It is also guaranteed that $$$r \geq l+k-1$$$ for all queries.

For an arbitrary array $$$b$$$, Yunli can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Select an index $$$i$$$. Set $$$b_i = x$$$ where $$$x$$$ is any integer she desires ($$$x$$$ is not limited to the interval $$$[1,n]$$$).

Denote $$$f(b)$$$ as the minimum number of operations she needs to perform until there exists a consecutive subarray$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of length at least $$$k$$$ in $$$b$$$.

Yunli is given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ and asks you $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you must output $$$\sum_{i=l}^{r-k+1} \sum_{j=i+k-1}^{r} f([a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_j])$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array, the length of the consecutive subarray, and the number of queries.

The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$).

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$, $$$r \geq l+k-1$$$) — the bounds of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output $$$\sum_{i=l}^{r-k+1} \sum_{j=i+k-1}^{r} f([a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_j])$$$ for each query on a new line.

After performing all operations, there will be several bulbs that are still on. Your goal is to make this number exactly $$$k$$$.

Find the smallest suitable $$$n$$$ such that after performing the operations there will be exactly $$$k$$$ bulbs on. We can show that an answer always exists.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Yes, this is another one of those constructive permutation problems.

You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You have to construct a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$, i. e. an array of $$$n$$$ integers, where every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once.

Every pair of adjacent elements in the permutation ($$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$) must meet the following condition:

- if one of them is divisible by the other, the condition $$$p_i < p_{i+1}$$$ must hold;
- otherwise, the condition $$$p_i > p_{i+1}$$$ must hold.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 99$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line, containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 100$$$).

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

- if no permutation of size $$$n$$$ meeting the conditions from the statement exists, print $$$-1$$$;
- otherwise, print $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ — the required permutation. If there are mutliple answers, print any of them.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given a string $$$s$$$ of the form <block of digits>+<block of digits>+...+<block of digits>. Every block of digits consists of at least $$$2$$$ and at most $$$13$$$ digits; every digit is from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.

You have to split this string into expressions of the form <integer>+<integer>. Every expression must be a contiguous part of the given string, and every character of the given string must belong to exactly one expression. For example, if you have a string 123+456+789+555, then:

- you are allowed to split it into 123+4, 56+7 and 89+555;
- you are not allowed to split it into 123+456 and +789+555, since the second part begins with a + sign;
- you are not allowed to split it into 123+4, 56+7, 8 and 9+555, since the third part does not contain a + sign;
- you are not allowed to split it into 123+456+78 and 9+555, since the first part contains two + signs.

Among all allowed ways to split the string, find one which maximizes the sum of results of all expressions you get, and print this sum.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing the string $$$s$$$ ($$$5 \le |s| \le 1000$$$) of the form <block of digits>+<block of digits>+...+<block of digits>. The string contains at least one '+' sign. Every block of digits consists of at least $$$2$$$ and at most $$$13$$$ digits; every digit is from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$.

For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible sum of results of all expressions you get after splitting the string.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: In a game you started playing recently, there is a field that can be represented as a rectangular grid. The field has $$$2$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns — $$$2n$$$ cells in total.

Some cells are empty, but some are occupied by wolves. In the beginning of the game, you have one sheep in some cell, and you'd like to save it from wolves.

Wolves will attack you at night, so you still have some time for preparation. You have two ways to deal with wolves:

1. You pay $$$h$$$ coins to hunters and choose a cell occupied by a wolf. Hunters will clear the cell, eradicating the wolf in it.
2. You pay $$$b$$$ coins to builders and choose an empty cell. Builders will dig a trench in the chosen cell that wolves can't cross.

Let's say that a wolf can reach the sheep if there is a path that starts at the wolf's cell and finishes at the sheep's cell. This path shouldn't contain any cells with trenches, and each two consecutive cells in the path should be neighbors (share a side).

What is the minimum total amount of money you should pay to ensure that none of the wolves can reach the sheep?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1200$$$) — the number of test cases. Next, $$$t$$$ independent cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le h, b \le 10^9$$$) — the size of the grid and corresponding costs.

The next two lines contain a description of the grid. The $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-th line is either '.', 'S' or 'W':

- '.' means that the cell is empty;
- 'S' means that the cell is occupied by the sheep; there is exactly one such cell on the grid;
- 'W' means that the cell is occupied by a wolf.

Additional constraints:

- there are no wolves in cells neighboring the sheep cell;
- the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum total amount of money you should pay to save your sheep.

During each round, every player chooses one of three moves: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Depending on the chosen moves, the following happens:

- if one player chooses Rock and the other player chooses Paper, the player who chooses Paper wins and gets a point;
- if one player chooses Scissors and the other player chooses Paper, the player who chooses Scissors wins and gets a point;
- if one player chooses Scissors and the other player chooses Rock, the player who chooses Rock wins and gets a point;
- and if both players choose the same move, nobody wins and nobody gets a point.

Monocarp decided to play against a bot. During the game, Monocarp noticed that the bot's behavior is very predictable:

- in the first round, it chooses Rock;
- in every round except the first, it chooses the move that beats the opponent's move in the previous round (for example, if in the previous round its opponent played Scissors, then the bot chooses Rock now).

Monocarp has a favorite string $$$s$$$, consisting of the characters R, P, and/or S. Monocarp decided to play a series of rounds against the bot. However, he wants both of the following conditions to be met:

- the final score is in favor of Monocarp (i. e., the number of rounds he won is strictly greater than the number of rounds the bot won);
- the string $$$s$$$ appears as a contiguous substring in the sequence of the bot's moves (where R denotes Rock, P denotes Paper, and S denotes Scissors).

Help Monocarp and calculate the minimum number of rounds he needs to play against the bot to satisfy both of the aforementioned conditions.

Input and Output Format:

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: There are $$$2$$$ queues of patients at the doors of two doctors. The first doctor sees patients in the usual order of the queue — whoever arrived first will be seen first. The second doctor does the opposite — he sees those who arrived last first. Thus, there is a queue for the first doctor and a stack for the second doctor. A patient can be in both the queue and the stack. Each patient is characterized by the time their visit to the doctor will take (the time is the same for both doctors).

When the appointments begin, the doctors will see patients in the order of the queue and stack, respectively. As soon as a doctor finishes with one patient, he will call the next one.

But there is one problem: if a patient is in both the queue and the stack, and he is called to one doctor first and then to the other, while he has not yet finished with the first one, confusion will arise. It is allowed for a patient to go to the second doctor at the exact moment he finishes with the first doctor.

The current configuration of the queue and stack is called good if the doctors can see all the patients without any confusion arising.

Initially, both the queue and the stack are empty. There are three types of queries:

1. add patient $$$x$$$ to the queue;
2. add patient $$$x$$$ to the stack;
3. patient $$$x$$$, who was in the queue, realizes he is in the wrong place and moves to the stack; however, he moves to the position in the stack as if he had entered the stack at the moment of the query when he entered the queue.

It is guaranteed that after each query, each patient is no more than once in the queue and no more than once in the stack.

After each query, you need to determine if the current configuration is good.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of requests.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — for each patient, the time their visit to the doctor will take.

Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$t$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 3$$$; $$$1 \le x \le n$$$) — the type of query and the patient's index. It is guaranteed that:

- if the query is of type $$$1$$$, then patient $$$x$$$ is not in the queue yet;
- if the query is of type $$$2$$$, then patient $$$x$$$ is not in the stack yet;
- if the query is of type $$$3$$$, then patient $$$x$$$ is in the queue already and not in the stack yet.

After each query, print "YES", if the current configuration is good, and "NO" otherwise.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: There is a matrix consisting of $$$2$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$ from top to bottom; the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Let's denote the cell on the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column as $$$(i,j)$$$. Each cell contains an integer; initially, the integer in the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is $$$a_{i,j}$$$.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

- choose two columns and swap them (i. e. choose two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$1 \le x < y \le n$$$, then swap $$$a_{1,x}$$$ with $$$a_{1,y}$$$, and then swap $$$a_{2,x}$$$ with $$$a_{2,y}$$$).

After performing the operations, you have to choose a path from the cell $$$(1,1)$$$ to the cell $$$(2,n)$$$. For every cell $$$(i,j)$$$ in the path except for the last, the next cell should be either $$$(i+1,j)$$$ or $$$(i,j+1)$$$. Obviously, the path cannot go outside the matrix.

The cost of the path is the sum of all integers in all $$$(n+1)$$$ cells belonging to the path. You have to perform the operations and choose a path so that its cost is maximum possible.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of three lines:

- the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5000$$$) — the number of columns in the matrix;
- the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1,1}, a_{1,2}, \ldots, a_{1,n}$$$ ($$$-10^5 \le a_{i,j} \le 10^5$$$) — the first row of the matrix;
- the third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{2,1}, a_{2,2}, \ldots, a_{2,n}$$$ ($$$-10^5 \le a_{i,j} \le 10^5$$$) — the second row of the matrix.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.

For each test case, print one integer — the maximum cost of a path you can obtain.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Once, four Roman merchants met in a Roman mansion to discuss their trading plans. They faced the following problem: they traded the same type of goods, and if they traded in the same city, they would inevitably incur losses. They decided to divide up the cities between them where they would trade.

The map of Rome can be represented in this problem as a plane with certain points marked — the cities of the Roman Empire.

The merchants decided to choose a certain dividing point $$$(x_0, y_0)$$$. Then, in a city with coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$,

- the first merchant sells goods if $$$x_0 \le x_i$$$ and $$$y_0 \le y_i$$$;
- the second merchant sells goods if $$$x_0 > x_i$$$ and $$$y_0 \le y_i$$$;
- the third merchant sells goods if $$$x_0 \le x_i$$$ and $$$y_0 > y_i$$$;
- the fourth merchant sells goods if $$$x_0 > x_i$$$ and $$$y_0 > y_i$$$.

The merchants want to choose $$$(x_0, y_0)$$$ in such a way as to maximize the smallest number of cities that any of them gets (i. e., as fair as possible). Please find such a point for them.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of cities on the map.

Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the cities.

Note that some points may coincide. This is because some cities may be so close that they cannot be distinguished on the map at the given scale.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, in the first line, print a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le \frac{n}{4}$$$) — the maximum possible number of cities that each merchant can get at a minimum.

In the second line, print two integers $$$x_0$$$ and $$$y_0$$$ ($$$|x_0|, |y_0| \le 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the dividing point. If there are multiple suitable points, print any of them.

The northern part of the Roman Empire consists of $$$n$$$ cities connected by $$$m$$$ one-way roads. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th city has $$$a_i$$$ messengers, and each messenger can freely move between cities following the existing roads. A messenger can carry a copy of the plan with him and inform the cities he visits, and can make unlimited copies for other messengers in the city he is currently in.

Find the smallest number of the plans you need to produce originally, so that the messengers will deliver them to every city, or determine that it is impossible to do so at all.

There is a problem-solving competition in Ancient Egypt with $$$n$$$ participants, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each participant comes from a certain city; the cities are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. There is at least one participant from each city.

The $$$i$$$-th participant has strength $$$a_i$$$, specialization $$$s_i$$$, and wisdom $$$b_i$$$, so that $$$b_i \ge a_i$$$. Each problem in the competition will have a difficulty $$$d$$$ and a unique topic $$$t$$$. The $$$i$$$-th participant will solve the problem if

- $$$s_i = t$$$, and $$$b_i \ge d$$$, i.e., their specialization matches the problem's topic, and their wisdom is not less than the problem's difficulty.

Cheops wants to choose the problems in such a way that each participant from city $$$i$$$ will solve strictly more problems than each participant from city $$$j$$$, for all $$$i < j$$$.

The next $$$m$$$ lines describe the cities. In the $$$i$$$-th line, the first number is an integer $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \le k_i \le n$$$) — the number of participants from the $$$i$$$-th city. It is followed by $$$k_i$$$ integers $$$q_{i, 1}, q_{i, 2}, \ldots, q_{i, k_i}$$$ — ($$$1 \le q_{i, j} \le n$$$, $$$1 \le j \le k_i$$$) — the indices of the participants from this city. It is guaranteed that each participant is mentioned exactly once.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, if there exists a set of problems that satisfies Cheops' conditions, then in the first line output a single integer $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \le p \le 5n$$$) — the number of problems in your solution.

There is a problem-solving competition in Ancient Egypt with $$$n$$$ participants, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each participant comes from a certain city; the cities are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. There is at least one participant from each city.

The $$$i$$$-th participant has strength $$$a_i$$$, specialization $$$s_i$$$, and wisdom $$$b_i$$$, so that $$$b_i \ge a_i$$$. Each problem in the competition will have a difficulty $$$d$$$ and a unique topic $$$t$$$. The $$$i$$$-th participant will solve the problem if

- $$$a_i \ge d$$$, i.e., their strength is not less than the problem's difficulty, or
- $$$s_i = t$$$, and $$$b_i \ge d$$$, i.e., their specialization matches the problem's topic, and their wisdom is not less than the problem's difficulty.

Cheops wants to choose the problems in such a way that each participant from city $$$i$$$ will solve strictly more problems than each participant from city $$$j$$$, for all $$$i < j$$$.

Please find a set of at most $$$5n$$$ problems, where the topics of all problems are distinct, so that Cheops' will is satisfied, or state that it is impossible.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le m \le n \le 3 \cdot {10}^5$$$) — the number of participants and the number of cities.

The following $$$n$$$ lines describe the participants. The $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers —$$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$s_i$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i, b_i, s_i \le {10}^9$$$, $$$a_i \le b_i$$$) — strength, wisdom, and specialization of the $$$i$$$-th participant, respectively.

The next $$$m$$$ lines describe the cities. In the $$$i$$$-th line, the first number is an integer $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \le k_i \le n$$$) — the number of participants from the $$$i$$$-th city. It is followed by $$$k_i$$$ integers $$$q_{i, 1}, q_{i, 2}, \ldots, q_{i, k_i}$$$ — ($$$1 \le q_{i, j} \le n$$$, $$$1 \le j \le k_i$$$) — the indices of the participants from this city. It is guaranteed that each participant is mentioned exactly once.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, if there exists a set of problems that satisfies Cheops' conditions, then in the first line output a single integer $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \le p \le 5n$$$) — the number of problems in your solution.

Then output $$$p$$$ lines, each containing two integers $$$d$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$0 \le d, t \le {10}^9$$$) — the difficulty and topic of the respective problem. The topics must be distinct.

If there is no set of problems that meets Cheops' wishes, print $$$-1$$$ instead.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, there are no question marks. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

For a long time, no one could decipher Sumerian cuneiform. However, it has finally succumbed to pressure! Today, you have the chance to decipher Yandex cuneiform.

Yandex cuneiform is defined by the following rules:

1. An empty string is a Yandex cuneiform.
2. If you insert exactly one copy of each of the three letters 'Y', 'D', and 'X' into a Yandex cuneiform in such a way that no two adjacent letters become equal after the operation, you obtain a Yandex cuneiform.
3. If a string can't be obtained using the above rules, it is not a Yandex cuneiform.

You are given a template. A template is a string consisting of the characters 'Y', 'D', 'X', and '?'.

You need to check whether there exists a way to replace each question mark with 'Y', 'D', or 'X' to obtain a Yandex cuneiform, and if it exists, output any of the matching options, as well as a sequence of insertion operations to obtain the resulting cuneiform.

In this version of the problem, there are no question marks in the template.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing a template of length $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n < 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \bmod 3 = 0$$$), consisting only of characters 'Y', 'D', 'X'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing 'NO' if it is not possible to obtain a cuneiform from the given template.

Otherwise, output 'YES' on the first line, and on the second line, any obtainable cuneiform. After that, you need to output the sequence of operations that leads to the cuneiform you printed.

A sequence of operations is described by $$$\frac{n}{3}$$$ triples of pairs. A pair has the form c p, where $$$c$$$ is one of the letters 'Y', 'D', or 'X', and $$$p$$$ is the position at which the letter $$$c$$$ should be inserted. The insertion position is the number of letters to skip from the beginning of the string for the insertion. For example, after inserting the character 'D' into the string "YDX" with $$$p=3$$$, the result is "YDXD", and with $$$p=0$$$, it is "DYDX". Note that the index cannot exceed the current length of the string.

The operations are applied from top to bottom, left to right. After inserting each triple to the string, there should be no two adjacent identical characters.

The machine has a total of $$$n$$$ slots. You know that initially, the $$$i$$$-th slot contains $$$a_i$$$ cans of lemonade. There are also $$$n$$$ buttons on the machine, each button corresponds to a slot, with exactly one button corresponding to each slot. Unfortunately, the labels on the buttons have worn off, so you do not know which button corresponds to which slot.

When you press the button corresponding to the $$$i$$$-th slot, one of two events occurs:

- If there is a can of lemonade in the $$$i$$$-th slot, it will drop out and you will take it. At this point, the number of cans in the $$$i$$$-th slot decreases by $$$1$$$.
- If there are no cans of lemonade left in the $$$i$$$-th slot, nothing will drop out.

After pressing, the can drops out so quickly that it is impossible to track from which slot it fell. The contents of the slots are hidden from your view, so you cannot see how many cans are left in each slot. The only thing you know is the initial number of cans in the slots: $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.

Determine the minimum number of button presses needed to guarantee that you receive at least $$$k$$$ cans of lemonade.

Note that you can adapt your strategy during the button presses based on whether you received a can or not. It is guaranteed that there are at least $$$k$$$ cans of lemonade in total in the machine. In other words, $$$k \leq a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of slots in the machine and the required number of cans of lemonade.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the number of cans in the slots.

It is guaranteed that $$$k \leq a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n$$$, meaning there are at least $$$k$$$ cans of lemonade in the machine.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of button presses needed to guarantee that you receive at least $$$k$$$ cans of lemonade.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Shohag has an array $$$a$$$ of integers. Initially $$$a = [0, 1]$$$. He can repeatedly perform the following operation any number of times:

- Let $$$k$$$ be the number of inversions$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ in the current array $$$a$$$.
- Insert $$$k$$$ at any position in $$$a$$$, including the beginning or the end.

For example, if $$$a = [4, 6, 2, 4]$$$, then the number of inversions is $$$k = 3$$$. So Shohag can obtain the following arrays after the operation: $$$[\textbf{3}, 4, 6, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[4, \textbf{3}, 6, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[4, 6, \textbf{3}, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[4, 6, 2, \textbf{3}, 4]$$$, and $$$[4, 6, 2, 4, \textbf{3}]$$$.

Pebae has an integer $$$m$$$. She wants to assign each node a value — an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. So she asks Shohag to count the number, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$, of assignments such that following conditions are satisfied:

- For each pair $$$1 \le u \lt v \le n$$$, the least common multiple (LCM) of the values of the nodes in the unique simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ is not divisible by the number of nodes in the path.
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values of all nodes from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is $$$1$$$.

You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$.

A cool swap walk is the following process:

- In an $$$n \times n$$$ grid, we note the cells in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ as $$$(i, j)$$$. You need to walk from $$$(1,1)$$$ to $$$(n,n)$$$, taking only steps to the right or down.
- Formally, if you are in $$$(x,y)$$$ currently, you can step to either $$$(x+1,y)$$$ or $$$(x,y+1)$$$, but you can not step beyond the boundaries of the grid.
- When you step in $$$(i,j)$$$, you must swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ when $$$i \neq j$$$.

You can perform at most $$$2n+4$$$ cool swap walks. Sort the array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ in non-decreasing order. We can show that it's always possible to do so.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 500$$$) — the size of the array.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2.5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, your output should consist of several lines:

- The first line contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \leq k \leq 2n+4$$$), representing the number of cool swap walks you perform.
- Each of the next $$$k$$$ lines contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$2n-2$$$ consisting only of R and D, representing the path (letters are case sensitive). For all $$$1 \le i \le 2n-2$$$, if $$$s_i=$$$ R, you walk right in the $$$i$$$-th step, otherwise you walk down in the $$$i$$$-th step.

In an array, Sakurako must place either a '+' or a '-' in front of each element so that the sum of all elements in the array equals $$$0$$$.

Sakurako is not sure if it is possible to solve this problem, so determine whether there is a way to assign signs such that the sum of all elements in the array equals $$$0$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 100$$$)  — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0\le a,b<10$$$)  — the number of '1's and the number of '2's in the array.

For each test case, output "Yes" if you can make the sum of the entire array equal to $$$0$$$, and "No" otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.

Examples of four beautiful binary matrices.

Today, Sakurako was playing with a beautiful binary matrix of size $$$r \times c$$$ and created a binary string $$$s$$$ by writing down all the rows of the matrix, starting from the first and ending with the $$$r$$$-th. More formally, the element from the matrix in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column corresponds to the $$$((i-1)*c+j)$$$-th element of the string.

You need to check whether the beautiful matrix from which the string $$$s$$$ was obtained could be squared. In other words, you need to check whether the string $$$s$$$ could have been build from a square beautiful binary matrix (i.e., one where $$$r=c$$$).

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string.

The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string is always the result of writing out the strings of a beautiful matrix.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Print "Yes", if the original matrix could have been square, and "No" otherwise.

If $$$p=[3,5,6,1,2,4]$$$, then, for example, $$$4$$$ is reachable from $$$1$$$, because: $$$i=1$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ $$$i=p_1=3$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ $$$i=p_3=6$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ $$$i=p_6=4$$$. Now $$$i=4$$$, so $$$4$$$ is reachable from $$$1$$$.

Each number in the permutation is colored either black or white.

Sakurako defines the function $$$F(i)$$$ as the number of black integers that are reachable from $$$i$$$.

Sakurako is interested in $$$F(i)$$$ for each $$$1\le i\le n$$$, but calculating all values becomes very difficult, so she asks you, as her good friend, to compute this.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1\le p_i\le n$$$)  — the elements of the permutation.

The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of '0' and '1'. If $$$s_i=0$$$, then the number $$$p_i$$$ is colored black; if $$$s_i=1$$$, then the number $$$p_i$$$ is colored white.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

She calls a string $$$s$$$ of lowercase Latin letters an alternating string if characters in the even positions are the same, if characters in the odd positions are the same, and the length of the string is even.

For example, the strings 'abab' and 'gg' are alternating, while the strings 'aba' and 'ggwp' are not.

As a good friend, you decided to gift such a string, but you couldn't find one. Luckily, you can perform two types of operations on the string:

1. Choose an index $$$i$$$ and delete the $$$i$$$-th character from the string, which will reduce the length of the string by $$$1$$$. This type of operation can be performed no more than $$$1$$$ time;
2. Choose an index $$$i$$$ and replace $$$s_i$$$ with any other letter.

Since you are in a hurry, you need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the string an alternating one.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$)  — the length of the string.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to turn the string $$$s$$$ into an alternating one.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Sakurako will soon take a test. The test can be described as an array of integers $$$n$$$ and a task on it:

Given an integer $$$x$$$, Sakurako can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$) such that $$$a_i\ge x$$$;
- Change the value of $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i-x$$$.

Using this operation any number of times, she must find the minimum possible median$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of the array $$$a$$$.

Sakurako knows the array but does not know the integer $$$x$$$. Someone let it slip that one of the $$$q$$$ values of $$$x$$$ will be in the next test, so Sakurako is asking you what the answer is for each such $$$x$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\le n,q\le 10^5$$$)  — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le n$$$)  — the elements of the array.

The following $$$q$$$ lines each contain one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le x\le n$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. The same guarantee applies to the sum of $$$q$$$ across all test cases.

For each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers  — the answer for each query.

The remaining element $$$x$$$ satisfies $$$-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$$$.

Find all possible sums of subarrays of $$$a$$$, including the empty subarray, whose sum is defined as $$$0$$$. In other words, find all integers $$$x$$$ such that the array $$$a$$$ has at least one subarray (possibly empty) with sum equal to $$$x$$$. A subarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array.

Output these sums in ascending order. Each sum should be printed only once, even if it is achieved by multiple subarrays.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then, $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines:

- The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array.
- The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. In the array $$$a$$$, there is at most one element that is neither $$$1$$$ nor $$$-1$$$.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output two lines:

- In the first line, print a single integer — the number of distinct subarray sums.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Recall the rules of the game "Nim". There are $$$n$$$ piles of stones, where the $$$i$$$-th pile initially contains some number of stones. Two players take turns choosing a non-empty pile and removing any positive (strictly greater than $$$0$$$) number of stones from it. The player unable to make a move loses the game.

You are given an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Artem and Ruslan decided to play Nim on segments of this array. Each of the $$$q$$$ rounds is defined by a segment $$$(l_i, r_i)$$$, where the elements $$$a_{l_i}, a_{l_i+1}, \dots, a_{r_i}$$$ represent the sizes of the piles of stones.

Before the game starts, Ruslan can remove any number of piles from the chosen segment. However, at least one pile must remain, so in a single round he can remove at most $$$(r_i - l_i)$$$ piles. He is allowed to remove $$$0$$$ piles. After the removal, the game is played on the remaining piles within the segment.

All rounds are independent: the changes made in one round do not affect the original array or any other rounds.

Ruslan wants to remove as many piles as possible so that Artem, who always makes the first move, loses.

For each round, determine:

1. the maximum number of piles Ruslan can remove;
2. the number of ways to choose the maximum number of piles for removal.

Two ways are considered different if there exists an index $$$i$$$ such that the pile at index $$$i$$$ is removed in one way but not in the other. Since the number of ways can be large, output it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

If Ruslan cannot ensure Artem's loss in a particular round, output -1 for that round.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 10^5$$$) — the size of the array and the number of segments for which the answers need to be calculated.

The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 50$$$) — the elements of the initial array.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$) — the bounds of the segment on which the boys want to play the game during the $$$i$$$-th round.

For each round:

- if Ruslan can win, print two integers — the maximum number of piles that can be removed, and the number of ways to remove the maximum number of piles, taken modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$;
- otherwise print -1.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Your task is to process $$$q$$$ queries of two types:

- $$$1~p~x$$$ — set the value of the element at index $$$p$$$ equal to $$$x$$$;
- $$$2~l~r$$$ — count the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$l \le i < j \le r$$$ and $$$a_i \ne a_j$$$.

Note that the queries in this task are encoded; each subsequent query can only be decoded after calculating the answer to the preceding query of the second type.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$).

The third line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.

The next $$$q$$$ lines describe the queries in one of the following formats:

- $$$1~p'~x'$$$ ($$$0 \le p', x' \le n-1$$$);
- $$$2~l'~r'$$$ ($$$0 \le l', r' \le n-1$$$).

The queries are encoded as follows: let $$$\mathit{last}$$$ be the answer to the latest processed query of the second type (initially, $$$\mathit{last} = 0$$$).

- if the type of the query is $$$1$$$, then $$$p = ((p' + \mathit{last}) \bmod n) + 1$$$, $$$x = ((x' + \mathit{last}) \bmod n) + 1$$$.
- if the type of the query is $$$2$$$, $$$l = ((l' + \mathit{last}) \bmod n) + 1$$$, $$$r = ((r' + \mathit{last}) \bmod n) + 1$$$. If $$$l > r$$$, swap their values.

Don't forget to update the value of $$$\mathit{last}$$$ after answering each query of the second type.

Additional constraint on the input: there is at least one query of the second type.

For each query of the second type, print the answer — the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$l \le i < j \le r$$$ and $$$a_i \ne a_j$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Pak Chanek has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. Since he is currently learning how to calculate the floored average of two numbers, he wants to practice it on his array $$$a$$$.

While the array $$$a$$$ has at least two elements, Pak Chanek will perform the following three-step operation:

1. Pick two different indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \leq i, j \leq |a|$$$; $$$i \neq j$$$), note that $$$|a|$$$ denotes the current size of the array $$$a$$$.
2. Append $$$\lfloor \frac{a_i+a_j}{2} \rfloor$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ to the end of the array.
3. Remove elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ from the array and concatenate the remaining parts of the array.

For example, suppose that $$$a=[5,4,3,2,1,1]$$$. If we choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=5$$$, the resulting array will be $$$a=[4,3,2,1,3]$$$. If we choose $$$i=4$$$ and $$$j=3$$$, the resulting array will be $$$a=[5,4,1,1,2]$$$.

After all operations, the array will consist of a single element $$$x$$$. Find the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ if Pak Chanek performs the operations optimally.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 50$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

Do note that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ after all numbers have been picked.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers and an integer $$$x$$$. You can do the following two-step operation any (possibly zero) number of times:

1. Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$).
2. Increase $$$a_i$$$ by $$$x$$$, in other words $$$a_i := a_i + x$$$.

Find the maximum value of the $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$a$$$ if you perform the operations optimally.

The $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ (minimum excluded value) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array. For example:

- The $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$[2,2,1]$$$ is $$$0$$$ because $$$0$$$ is not in the array.
- The $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$[3,1,0,1]$$$ is $$$2$$$ because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ are in the array but $$$2$$$ is not.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. In the two versions, the constraints on $$$q$$$ and the time limit are different. In this version, $$$q=0$$$. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.

A team consisting of $$$n$$$ members, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, is set to present a slide show at a large meeting. The slide show contains $$$m$$$ slides.

There is an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Initially, the members are standing in a line in the order of $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ from front to back. The slide show will be presented in order from slide $$$1$$$ to slide $$$m$$$. Each section will be presented by the member at the front of the line. After each slide is presented, you can move the member at the front of the line to any position in the lineup (without changing the order of the rest of the members). For example, suppose the line of members is $$$[\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$$$. After member $$$3$$$ presents the current slide, you can change the line of members into either $$$[\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$$$, $$$[1,\color{red}{3},2,4]$$$, $$$[1,2,\color{red}{3},4]$$$ or $$$[1,2,4,\color{red}{3}]$$$.

There is also an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$. The slide show is considered good if it is possible to make member $$$b_i$$$ present slide $$$i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ under these constraints.

However, your annoying boss wants to make $$$q$$$ updates to the array $$$b$$$. In the $$$i$$$-th update, he will choose a slide $$$s_i$$$ and a member $$$t_i$$$ and set $$$b_{s_i} := t_i$$$. Note that these updates are persistent, that is changes made to the array $$$b$$$ will apply when processing future updates.

For each of the $$$q+1$$$ states of array $$$b$$$, the initial state and after each of the $$$q$$$ updates, determine if the slideshow is good.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$q=0$$$) — the number of members, the number of sections and the number of updates.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the initial order of the members from front to back. It is guaranteed that each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once in $$$a$$$.

The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le n$$$) — the members who should present each section.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ respectively.

For each test case, output $$$q+1$$$ lines corresponding to the $$$q+1$$$ states of the array $$$b$$$. Output "YA" if the slide show is good, and "TIDAK" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yA", "Ya", "ya", and "YA" will be recognized as positive responses.

His friend will sell drinks for $$$n$$$ days, numbered from day $$$1$$$ to day $$$n$$$. There are also $$$m$$$ types of drinks, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$.

The profit gained from selling a drink on a particular day can vary. On day $$$i$$$, the projected profit from selling drink of type $$$j$$$ is $$$A_{i, j}$$$. Note that $$$A_{i, j}$$$ can be negative, meaning that selling the drink would actually incur a loss.

Pak Chanek wants to help his friend plan the sales over the $$$n$$$ days. On day $$$i$$$, Pak Chanek must choose to sell at least one type of drink. Furthermore, the types of drinks sold on a single day must form a subarray. In other words, in each day, Pak Chanek will select $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \leq i \leq j \leq m$$$. Then all types of drinks between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ (inclusive) will be sold.

However, to ensure that customers from the previous day keep returning, the selection of drink types sold on day $$$i$$$ ($$$i>1$$$) must meet the following conditions:

- At least one drink type sold on day $$$i$$$ must also have been sold on day $$$i-1$$$.
- At least one drink type sold on day $$$i$$$ must not have been sold on day $$$i-1$$$.

The daily profit is the sum of the profits from all drink types sold on that day. The total profit from the sales plan is the sum of the profits over $$$n$$$ days. What is the maximum total profit that can be achieved if Pak Chanek plans the sales optimally?

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$3 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$n \cdot m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rows and columns in a grid.

The next $$$n$$$ lines of each test case contain $$$m$$$ integers each, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains the integers $$$A_{i,1} A_{i,2}, \ldots, A_{i,m}$$$ ($$$-10^9 \leq A_{i,j} \leq 10^9$$$) — project profits of each drink type on the $$$i$$$-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum profit that Pak Chanek can achieve.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is a simplified version of the problem. It differs from the difficult one only in its constraints.

At the Berland State University, the local network between servers does not always operate without errors. When transmitting two identical messages consecutively, an error may occur, resulting in the two messages merging into one. In this merging, the end of the first message coincides with the beginning of the second. Of course, the merging can only occur at identical characters. The length of the merging must be a positive number less than the length of the message text.

For example, when transmitting two messages "abrakadabra" consecutively, it is possible that it will be transmitted with the described type of error, resulting in a message like "abrakadabrabrakadabra" or "abrakadabrakadabra' (in the first case, the merging occurred at one character, and in the second case, at four).

Given the received message t, determine if it is possible that this is the result of an error of the described type in the operation of the local network, and if so, determine a possible value of s.

A situation where two messages completely overlap each other should not be considered an error. For example, if the received message is "abcd", it should be considered that there is no error in it. Similarly, simply appending one message after another is not a sign of an error. For instance, if the received message is "abcabc", it should also be considered that there is no error in it.

Input and Output Format:
The input consists of a single non-empty string t, consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. The length of the string t does not exceed 100 characters.

If the message t cannot contain an error, output "NO" (without quotes) in a single line of output.

Otherwise, in the first line, output "YES" (without quotes), and in the next line, output the string s — a possible message that could have led to the error. If there are multiple possible answers, any of them is acceptable.

abrakadabrabrakadabra

At the Berland State University, the local network between servers does not always operate without errors. When transmitting two identical messages consecutively, an error may occur, resulting in the two messages merging into one. In this merging, the end of the first message coincides with the beginning of the second. Of course, the merging can only occur at identical characters. The length of the merging must be a positive number less than the length of the message text.

For example, when transmitting two messages "abrakadabra" consecutively, it is possible that it will be transmitted with the described type of error, resulting in a message like "abrakadabrabrakadabra" or "abrakadabrakadabra' (in the first case, the merging occurred at one character, and in the second case, at four).

Given the received message t, determine if it is possible that this is the result of an error of the described type in the operation of the local network, and if so, determine a possible value of s.

A situation where two messages completely overlap each other should not be considered an error. For example, if the received message is "abcd", it should be considered that there is no error in it. Similarly, simply appending one message after another is not a sign of an error. For instance, if the received message is "abcabc", it should also be considered that there is no error in it.

Input and Output Format:
The input consists of a single non-empty string t, consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. The length of the string t does not exceed 4·105 characters.

If the message t cannot contain an error, output "NO" (without quotes) in a single line of output.

Otherwise, in the first line, output "YES" (without quotes), and in the next line, output the string s — a possible message that could have led to the error. If there are multiple possible answers, any of them is acceptable.

Inputs:
abrakadabrabrakadabra

- On the first day, she starts by placing the central piece in the center of the table.
- On each day after the first one, she places a certain number of pieces around the central piece in clockwise order, always finishing each square layer completely before starting a new one.

For example, she places the first $$$14$$$ pieces in the following order:

The colors denote the layers. The third layer is still unfinished.

Alyona is happy if at the end of the day the assembled part of the puzzle does not have any started but unfinished layers. Given the number of pieces she assembles on each day, find the number of days Alyona is happy on.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$), the number of days.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$, $$$a_1 = 1$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of pieces Alyona assembles on the $$$i$$$-th day.

It is guaranteed in each test case that at the end of the $$$n$$$ days, there are no unfinished layers.

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of days when Alyona is happy.

Marian sold her last ware at the Market at the same time Robin finished training at the Major Oak. They couldn't wait to meet, so they both start without delay.

The travel network is represented as $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ edges. The $$$i$$$-th edge connects vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, and takes $$$w_i$$$ seconds to travel (all $$$w_i$$$ are even). Marian starts at vertex $$$1$$$ (Market) and Robin starts at vertex $$$n$$$ (Major Oak).

In addition, $$$h$$$ of the $$$n$$$ vertices each has a single horse available. Both Marian and Robin are capable riders, and could mount horses in no time (i.e. in $$$0$$$ seconds). Travel times are halved when riding. Once mounted, a horse lasts the remainder of the travel. Meeting must take place on a vertex (i.e. not on an edge). Either could choose to wait on any vertex.

Output the earliest time Robin and Marian can meet. If vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ are disconnected, output $$$-1$$$ as the meeting is cancelled.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$h$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, \;1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5, \; 1 \le h \le n$$$) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and the number of vertices that have a single horse.

The second line of each test case contains $$$h$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_h$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the vertices that have a single horse available.

Then follow $$$m$$$ lines of each test case, each with three integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1\le u_i,v_i \le n, \; 2\le w_i \le 10^6$$$) — meaning that there is an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ with travel cost $$$w_i$$$ seconds without a horse.

There are no self loops or multiple edges. By good fortune, all $$$w_i$$$ are even integers.

It is guaranteed that the sums of both $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer, the earliest time Robin and Marian can meet. If it is impossible for them to meet, output $$$-1$$$.

Sheriff of Nottingham built the camps with strategy in mind and thus there are exactly $$$n$$$ camps numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$n-1$$$ trails, each connecting two camps. Any camp can be reached from any other camp. Each camp $$$i$$$ has initially $$$a_i$$$ gold.

As it is now, all camps would be destroyed by Robin. Sheriff can strengthen a camp by subtracting exactly $$$c$$$ gold from each of its neighboring camps and use it to build better defenses for that camp. Strengthening a camp doesn't change its gold, only its neighbors' gold. A camp can have negative gold.

After Robin Hood's attack, all camps that have been strengthened survive the attack, all others are destroyed.

What's the maximum gold Sheriff can keep in his surviving camps after Robin Hood's attack if he strengthens his camps optimally?

Camp $$$a$$$ is neighboring camp $$$b$$$ if and only if there exists a trail connecting $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. Only strengthened camps count towards the answer, as others are destroyed.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case begins with two integers $$$n$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le c \le 10^9$$$) — the number of camps and the gold taken from each neighboring camp for strengthening.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the initial gold of each camp.

Then follow $$$n-1$$$ lines, each with integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$u \ne v$$$) — meaning that there is a trail between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$.

It is guaranteed that any camp is reachable from any other camp.

Output a single integer, the maximum gold Sheriff of Nottingham can keep in his surviving camps after Robin Hood's attack.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Little John is as little as night is day — he was known to be a giant, at possibly $$$2.1$$$ metres tall. It has everything to do with his love for milk.

His dairy diary has $$$n$$$ entries, showing that he acquired $$$a_i$$$ pints of fresh milk on day $$$d_i$$$. Milk declines in freshness with time and stays drinkable for a maximum of $$$k$$$ days. In other words, fresh milk acquired on day $$$d_i$$$ will be drinkable between days $$$d_i$$$ and $$$d_i+k-1$$$ inclusive.

Every day, Little John drinks drinkable milk, up to a maximum of $$$m$$$ pints. In other words, if there are less than $$$m$$$ pints of milk, he will drink them all and not be satisfied; if there are at least $$$m$$$ pints of milk, he will drink exactly $$$m$$$ pints and be satisfied, and it's a milk satisfaction day.

Little John always drinks the freshest drinkable milk first.

Determine the number of milk satisfaction days for Little John.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t \leq 10^4$$$), the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1\le n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k \le 10^5$$$), the number of diary entries, the maximum pints needed for a milk satisfaction day, and the duration of milk's freshness.

Then follow $$$n$$$ lines of each test case, each with two integers $$$d_i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1\le d_i$$$, $$$a_i \le 10^6$$$), the day on which the milk was acquired and the number of pints acquired. They are sorted in increasing values of $$$d_i$$$, and all values of $$$d_i$$$ are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer, the number of milk satisfaction days.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Sheriff of Nottingham has organized a tournament in archery. It's the final round and Robin Hood is playing against Sheriff!

There are $$$n$$$ targets in a row numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. When a player shoots target $$$i$$$, their score increases by $$$a_i$$$ and the target $$$i$$$ is destroyed. The game consists of turns and players alternate between whose turn it is. Robin Hood always starts the game, then Sheriff and so on. The game continues until all targets are destroyed. Both players start with score $$$0$$$.

At the end of the game, the player with most score wins and the other player loses. If both players have the same score, it's a tie and no one wins or loses. In each turn, the player can shoot any target that wasn't shot before. Both play optimally to get the most score possible.

Sheriff of Nottingham has a suspicion that he might lose the game! This cannot happen, you must help Sheriff. Sheriff will pose $$$q$$$ queries, each specifying $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. This means that the game would be played only with targets $$$l, l+1, \dots, r$$$, as others would be removed by Sheriff before the game starts.

For each query $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, determine whether the Sheriff can not lose the game when only considering the targets $$$l, l+1, \dots, r$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n,q \le 2\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of targets and the queries Sheriff will pose.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^6$$$) — the points for hitting each target.

Then follow $$$q$$$ lines, each with two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) — the range of the targets that is considered for each query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of both $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each query, output "YES", if the Sheriff does not lose the game when only considering the targets $$$l, l+1, \dots, r$$$, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

In one second, you can do one of the following two actions:

- choose a screen and an uppercase Latin letter, and append that letter to the end of the sequence displayed on that screen;
- choose a screen and copy the sequence from it to the other screen, overwriting the sequence that was displayed on the other screen.

You have to calculate the minimum number of seconds you have to spend so that the first screen displays the sequence $$$s$$$, and the second screen displays the sequence $$$t$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Recently, akshiM met a task that needed binomial coefficients to solve. He wrote a code he usually does that looked like this:

Unfortunately, he made an error, since the right formula is the following:

But his team member keblidA is interested in values that were produced using the wrong formula. Please help him to calculate these coefficients for $$$t$$$ various pairs $$$(n_i, k_i)$$$. Note that they should be calculated according to the first (wrong) formula.

Since values $$$C[n_i][k_i]$$$ may be too large, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of pairs. Next, $$$t$$$ pairs are written in two lines.

The second line contains $$$t$$$ integers $$$n_1, n_2, \dots, n_t$$$ ($$$2 \le n_i \le 10^5$$$).

The third line contains $$$t$$$ integers $$$k_1, k_2, \dots, k_t$$$ ($$$1 \le k_i < n_i$$$).

Print $$$t$$$ integers $$$C[n_i][k_i]$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: There's a new game Monocarp wants to play. The game uses a deck of $$$n$$$ cards, where the $$$i$$$-th card has exactly one integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it.

At the beginning of the game, on the first turn, Monocarp can take any card from the deck. During each subsequent turn, Monocarp can take exactly one card that has either the same number as on the card taken on the previous turn or a number that is one greater than the number on the card taken on the previous turn.

In other words, if on the previous turn Monocarp took a card with the number $$$x$$$, then on the current turn he can take either a card with the number $$$x$$$ or a card with the number $$$x + 1$$$. Monocarp can take any card which meets that condition, regardless of its position in the deck.

After Monocarp takes a card on the current turn, it is removed from the deck.

According to the rules of the game, the number of distinct numbers written on the cards that Monocarp has taken must not exceed $$$k$$$.

If, after a turn, Monocarp cannot take a card without violating the described rules, the game ends.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of cards that Monocarp can take from the deck during the game, given that on the first turn he can take any card from the deck.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 200\,000$$$) — the number of cards in the deck and the maximum number of distinct numbers that can be written on the cards that Monocarp takes.

The second line contains a sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^{9}$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number written on the $$$i$$$-th card.

Additional constraint of the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$200\,000$$$.

For each test case, print the maximum number of cards that Monocarp can take from the deck during the game, given that on the first turn he can take any card from the deck.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Imagine a game where you play as a character that has two attributes: "Strength" and "Intelligence", that are at zero level initially.

During the game, you'll acquire $$$m$$$ attribute points that allow you to increase your attribute levels — one point will increase one of the attributes by one level. But sometimes, you'll encounter a so-called "Attribute Checks": if your corresponding attribute is high enough, you'll pass it; otherwise, you'll fail it.

Spending some time, you finally prepared a list which contains records of all points you got and all checks you've met. And now you're wondering: what is the maximum number of attribute checks you can pass in a single run if you'd spend points wisely?

Note that you can't change the order of records.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 5000$$$; $$$m < n \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the number of records in the list and the total number of points you'll get during the game.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n$$$ ($$$-m \le r_i \le m$$$), where $$$r_i$$$ encodes the $$$i$$$-th record:

- If $$$r_i = 0$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th record is an acquiring one attribute point. You can spend to level up either Strength or Intelligence;
- If $$$r_i > 0$$$, then it's an Intelligence check: if your Intelligence level is greater than or equal to $$$|r_i|$$$, you pass.
- If $$$r_i < 0$$$, then it's a Strength check: if your Strength level is greater than or equal to $$$|r_i|$$$, you pass.

Additional constraint on the input: the sequence $$$r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n$$$ contains exactly $$$m$$$ elements equal to $$$0$$$.

Print one integer — the maximum number of checks you can pass.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: In the most popular card game in Berland, a deck of $$$n \times m$$$ cards is used. Each card has two parameters: suit and rank. Suits in the game are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and ranks are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. There is exactly one card in the deck for each combination of suit and rank.

A card with suit $$$a$$$ and rank $$$b$$$ can beat a card with suit $$$c$$$ and rank $$$d$$$ in one of two cases:

- $$$a = 1$$$, $$$c \ne 1$$$ (a card of suit $$$1$$$ can beat a card of any other suit);
- $$$a = c$$$, $$$b > d$$$ (a card can beat any other card of the same suit but of a lower rank).

Two players play the game. Before the game starts, they receive exactly half of the deck each. The first player wins if for every card of the second player, he can choose his card that can beat it, and there is no card that is chosen twice (i. e. there exists a matching of the first player's cards with the second player's cards such that in each pair the first player's card beats the second player's card). Otherwise, the second player wins.

Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute the cards so that the first player wins. Two ways are considered different if there exists a card such that in one way it belongs to the first player and in the other way it belongs to the second player. The number of ways can be very large, so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 500$$$).

Additional constraint on the input: $$$m$$$ is even.

Print a single integer — the number of ways to distribute the cards so that the first player wins, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.

You have to process $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of two different integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$. During the $$$i$$$-th query, you have to choose an integer $$$p$$$ (which is either $$$x_i$$$ or $$$y_i$$$) and an integer $$$d$$$ (which is either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$), and assign $$$a_p = a_p + d$$$.

After each query, every element of $$$a$$$ should be a non-negative integer.

Process all queries in such a way that the sum of all elements of $$$a$$$ after the last query is the minimum possible.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$ and the number of queries, respectively.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Monocarp is gathering an army to fight a dragon in a videogame.

The army consists of two parts: the heroes and the defensive artifacts. Each hero has one parameter — his health. Each defensive artifact also has one parameter — its durability.

Before the battle begins, Monocarp distributes artifacts to the heroes so that each hero receives at most one artifact.

The battle consists of rounds that proceed as follows:

- first, the dragon deals damage equal to $$$\frac{1}{a + b}$$$ (a real number without rounding) to each hero, where $$$a$$$ is the number of heroes alive and $$$b$$$ is the number of active artifacts;
- after that, all heroes with health $$$0$$$ or less die;
- finally, some artifacts are deactivated. An artifact with durability $$$x$$$ is deactivated when one of the following occurs: the hero holding the artifact either dies or receives $$$x$$$ total damage (from the start of the battle). If an artifact is not held by any hero, it is inactive from the beginning of the battle.

The battle ends when there are no heroes left alive.

Initially, the army is empty. There are $$$q$$$ queries: add a hero with health $$$x$$$ or an artifact with durability $$$y$$$ to the army. After each query, determine the maximum number of rounds that Monocarp can survive if he distributes the artifacts optimally.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.

In the $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines, there are two integers $$$t_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$t_i \in \{1, 2\}$$$; $$$1 \le v_i \le 10^9$$$) — the type of the query and the value of the query parameter. If the type is $$$1$$$, a hero with health $$$v_i$$$ is added. If the type is $$$2$$$, an artifact with durability $$$v_i$$$ is added.

Print $$$q$$$ integers. After each query, output the maximum number of rounds that Monocarp can survive if he distributes the artifacts optimally.

- First, you choose an index $$$k$$$ such that $$$1\le k\le |s| - 1$$$ and $$$s_{k} \neq s_{k+1}$$$. If it is impossible to choose such an index, you lose;
- Then, you replace $$$s_ks_{k+1}$$$ with $$$r_i$$$. Note that this decreases the length of $$$s$$$ by $$$1$$$.

If all the $$$n-1$$$ operations are performed successfully, you win.

Determine whether it is possible for you to win this game.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$.

The second line contains the binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$s_i=\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$\mathtt{1}$$$).

The third line contains the binary string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n-1$$$ ($$$r_i=\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$\mathtt{1}$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if you can win the game, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Kevin used to be a participant of Codeforces. Recently, the KDOI Team has developed a new Online Judge called Forcescode.

Kevin has participated in $$$n$$$ contests on Forcescode. In the $$$i$$$-th contest, his performance rating is $$$a_i$$$.

Now he has hacked into the backend of Forcescode and will select an interval $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1\le l\le r\le n$$$), then skip all of the contests in this interval. After that, his rating will be recalculated in the following way:

- Initially, his rating is $$$x=0$$$;
- For each $$$1\le i\le n$$$, after the $$$i$$$-th contest,   If $$$l\le i\le r$$$, this contest will be skipped, and the rating will remain unchanged;  Otherwise, his rating will be updated according to the following rules:   If $$$a_i>x$$$, his rating $$$x$$$ will increase by $$$1$$$;  If $$$a_i=x$$$, his rating $$$x$$$ will remain unchanged;  If $$$a_i<x$$$, his rating $$$x$$$ will decrease by $$$1$$$.

You have to help Kevin to find his maximum possible rating after the recalculation if he chooses the interval $$$[l,r]$$$ optimally. Note that Kevin has to skip at least one contest.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 5\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 3\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of contests.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le n$$$) — the performance ratings in the contests.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible rating after the recalculation if Kevin chooses the interval optimally.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.

You can perform the following operation at most $$$2\cdot \max(n,m)$$$ times:

- Choose three distinct vertices $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, then for each of the edges $$$(a,b)$$$, $$$(b,c)$$$, and $$$(c,a)$$$, do the following:   If the edge does not exist, add it. On the contrary, if it exists, remove it.

A graph is called cool if and only if one of the following holds:

- The graph has no edges, or
- The graph is a tree.

You have to make the graph cool by performing the above operations. Note that you can use at most $$$2\cdot \max(n,m)$$$ operations.

It can be shown that there always exists at least one solution.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3\le n\le 10^5$$$, $$$0\le m\le \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2},2\cdot 10^5\right)$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges.

Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1\le u_i,v_i\le n$$$) — the two nodes that the $$$i$$$-th edge connects.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple-edges in the given graph.

For each test case, in the first line output an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\le k\le 2\cdot \max(n, m)$$$) — the number of operations.

Then output $$$k$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th line containing three distinct integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1\le a,b,c\le n$$$) — the three integers you choose in the $$$i$$$-th operation.

If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: For two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x,y\ge 2$$$), we will say that $$$x$$$ is a generator of $$$y$$$ if and only if $$$x$$$ can be transformed to $$$y$$$ by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero):

- Choose a divisor $$$d$$$ ($$$d\ge 2$$$) of $$$x$$$, then increase $$$x$$$ by $$$d$$$.

For example,

- $$$3$$$ is a generator of $$$8$$$ since we can perform the following operations: $$$3 \xrightarrow{d = 3} 6 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 8$$$;
- $$$4$$$ is a generator of $$$10$$$ since we can perform the following operations: $$$4 \xrightarrow{d = 4} 8 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 10$$$;
- $$$5$$$ is not a generator of $$$6$$$ since we cannot transform $$$5$$$ into $$$6$$$ with the operation above.

Now, Kevin gives you an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers ($$$a_i\ge 2$$$).

You have to find an integer $$$x\ge 2$$$ such that for each $$$1\le i\le n$$$, $$$x$$$ is a generator of $$$a_i$$$, or determine that such an integer does not exist.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer $$$x$$$ — the integer you found. Print $$$-1$$$ if there does not exist a valid $$$x$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: There is an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Initially, all elements of $$$a$$$ are equal to $$$0$$$.

Kevin can perform several operations on the array. Each operation is one of the following two types:

- Prefix addition — Kevin first selects an index $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le x\le n$$$), and then for each $$$1\le j\le x$$$, increases $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$;
- Suffix addition — Kevin first selects an index $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le x\le n$$$), and then for each $$$x\le j\le n$$$, increases $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$.

In the country of KDOI, people think that the integer $$$v$$$ is balanced. Thus, Iris gives Kevin an array $$$c$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers and defines the beauty of the array $$$a$$$ as follows:

- Initially, set $$$b=0$$$;
- For each $$$1\le i\le n$$$, if $$$a_i=v$$$, add $$$c_i$$$ to $$$b$$$;
- The beauty of $$$a$$$ is the final value of $$$b$$$.

Kevin wants to maximize the beauty of $$$a$$$ after all the operations. However, he had already performed $$$m$$$ operations when he was sleepy. Now, he can perform an arbitrary number (possibly zero) of new operations.

You have to help Kevin find the maximum possible beauty if he optimally performs the new operations.

However, to make sure that you are not just rolling the dice, Kevin gives you an integer $$$V$$$, and you need to solve the problem for each $$$1\le v\le V$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$V$$$ ($$$1\le n, m\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\le V\le 2000$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$, the number of initial operations, and the number that Kevin gives you.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1\le c_i\le 10^9$$$) — the elements in the array $$$c$$$.

Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line containing a character $$$op$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$op=\mathtt{L}$$$ or $$$\mathtt{R}$$$, $$$1\le x\le n$$$) — the type of the $$$i$$$-th operation and the selected index.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Given is an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. Each edge connects two vertices $$$(u, v)$$$ and has a probability of $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$ of appearing each day.

Initially, vertex $$$1$$$ has a message. At the end of the day, a vertex has a message if and only if itself or at least one of the vertices adjacent to it had the message the day before. Note that each day, each edge chooses its appearance independently.

Calculate the expected number of days before all the vertices have the message, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\leq n\leq 21$$$, $$$n-1\leq m\leq\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$).

Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each containing four integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, $$$p$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\leq u\neq v\leq n$$$, $$$1\leq p<q<998\,244\,353$$$, $$$\gcd(p,q)=1$$$) — there is an undirected edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and it has a probability of appearance of $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$ each day.

It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple-edges in the graph and that the graph is connected if all of the edges appear.

Additional constraint in the input: Let $$$g_{i,j}$$$ be the probability of appearance of the edge between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$g_{i,j}=0$$$ if there is no edge between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$). It is guaranteed that for any $$$S\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$$$ ($$$|S|\ge 1$$$), $$$$$$ \prod_{i\in S}\left(\prod_{j\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\setminus S}(1-g_{i,j})\right)\not\equiv1\pmod{998\,244\,353}. $$$$$$

Print a single integer in the only line of the output — the expected number of days, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Formally, let $$$M = 998\,244\,353$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Kevin has recently learned the definition of variance. For an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, the variance of $$$a$$$ is defined as follows:

- Let $$$x=\dfrac{1}{n}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$$$, i.e., $$$x$$$ is the mean of the array $$$a$$$;
- Then, the variance of $$$a$$$ is $$$$$$ V(a)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-x)^2. $$$$$$

Now, Kevin gives you an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers, as well as an integer $$$k$$$. You can perform the following operation on $$$a$$$:

- Select an interval $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1\le l\le r\le n$$$), then for each $$$l\le i\le r$$$, increase $$$a_i$$$ by $$$k$$$.

For each $$$1\le p\le m$$$, you have to find the minimum possible variance of $$$a$$$ after exactly $$$p$$$ operations are performed, independently for each $$$p$$$.

For simplicity, you only need to output the answers multiplied by $$$n^2$$$. It can be proven that the results are always integers.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\le n,m\le 5000$$$, $$$\color{red}{n\cdot m\le 2\cdot 10^4}$$$, $$$1\le k\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$, the maximum number of operations, and the number you add to $$$a_i$$$ each time, respectively.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\cdot m$$$ over all tests does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^4$$$.

For each test case, output $$$m$$$ integers in a single line, the $$$p$$$-th integer denoting the minimum possible variance of $$$a$$$ when exactly $$$p$$$ operations are performed, multiplied by $$$n^2$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ and/or $$$\mathtt{1}$$$. In one operation, you can select a non-empty subsequence $$$t$$$ from $$$s$$$ such that any two adjacent characters in $$$t$$$ are different. Then, you flip each character of $$$t$$$ ($$$\mathtt{0}$$$ becomes $$$\mathtt{1}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{1}$$$ becomes $$$\mathtt{0}$$$). For example, if $$$s=\mathtt{\underline{0}0\underline{101}}$$$ and $$$t=s_1s_3s_4s_5=\mathtt{0101}$$$, after the operation, $$$s$$$ becomes $$$\mathtt{\underline{1}0\underline{010}}$$$.

Calculate the minimum number of operations required to change all characters in $$$s$$$ to $$$\mathtt{0}$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You have a sequence of $$$n$$$ time clocks arranged in a line, where the initial time on the $$$i$$$-th clock is $$$a_i$$$. In each second, the following happens in order:

- Each clock's time decreases by $$$1$$$. If any clock's time reaches $$$0$$$, you lose immediately.
- You can choose to move to an adjacent clock or stay at the clock you are currently on.
- You can reset the time of the clock you are on back to its initial value $$$a_i$$$.

Note that the above events happen in order. If the time of a clock reaches $$$0$$$ in a certain second, even if you can move to this clock and reset its time during that second, you will still lose.

You can start from any clock. Determine if it is possible to continue this process indefinitely without losing.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of time clocks.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial times set on the clocks.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to continue this process indefinitely, or "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ with $$$n$$$ nodes and values $$$l_i, r_i$$$ for each node. You can choose an initial value $$$a_i$$$ satisfying $$$l_i\le a_i\le r_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th node. A tree is balanced if all node values are equal, and the value of a balanced tree is defined as the value of any node.

In one operation, you can choose two nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and increase the values of all nodes in the subtree$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of node $$$v$$$ by $$$1$$$ while considering $$$u$$$ as the root of the entire tree. Note that $$$u$$$ may be equal to $$$v$$$.

Your goal is to perform a series of operations so that the tree becomes balanced. Find the minimum possible value of the tree after performing these operations. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of input test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.

Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$l_i,r_i$$$ ($$$0\le l_i \le r_i\le 10^9$$$) — the constraint of the value of the $$$i$$$-th node.

The next $$$n-1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i,v_i$$$ ($$$1\le u_i,v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$) — an edge connecting $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible value that all $$$a_i$$$ can be made equal to after performing the operations. It can be shown that the answer always exists.

Cirno and Daiyousei are playing a game with a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$n$$$ nodes, rooted at node $$$1$$$. The value of the $$$i$$$-th node is $$$w_i$$$. They take turns to play the game; Cirno goes first.

In each turn, assuming the opponent chooses $$$j$$$ in the last turn, the player can choose any remaining node $$$i$$$ satisfying $$$w_i>w_j$$$ and delete the subtree$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of node $$$i$$$. In particular, Cirno can choose any node and delete its subtree in the first turn.

The first player who can not operate wins, and they all hope to win. Find one of the possible nodes Cirno may choose so that she wins if both of them play optimally.

Input and Output Format:

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: In a two-dimensional universe, a star can be represented by a point $$$(x,y)$$$ on a two-dimensional plane. Two stars are directly connected if and only if their $$$x$$$ or $$$y$$$ coordinates are the same, and there are no other stars on the line segment between them. Define a galaxy as a connected component composed of stars connected directly or indirectly (through other stars).

For a set of stars, its value is defined as the minimum number of galaxies that can be obtained after performing the following operation for any (possibly, zero) times: in each operation, you can select a point $$$(x,y)$$$ without stars. If a star can be directly connected to at least $$$3$$$ stars after creating it here, then you create a star here.

You are given a $$$n\times n$$$ matrix $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ describing a set $$$S$$$ of stars. There is a star at $$$(x,y)$$$ if and only if $$$a_{x,y}=1$$$. Calculate the sum, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$, of the values of all non-empty subsets of $$$S$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 14$$$) — the size of matrix $$$a$$$.

Then $$$n$$$ lines follow; the $$$i$$$-th line contains a string $$$a_i$$$ of length $$$n$$$ — the $$$i$$$-th row of matrix $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$2^n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2^{14}$$$.

For each test case, output the sum, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$, of the values of all non-empty subsets of $$$S$$$.

So he would try out for many new things, such as... being a carpenter. To learn it well, Cocoly decides to become an apprentice of Master, but in front of him lies a hard task waiting for him to solve.

Cocoly is given an array $$$a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n$$$. Master calls a set of integers $$$S$$$ stable if and only if, for any possible $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, and $$$w$$$ from the set $$$S$$$ (note that $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, and $$$w$$$ do not necessarily have to be pairwise distinct), sticks of length $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, and $$$w$$$ can form a non-degenerate triangle$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$.

Cocoly is asked to partition the array $$$a$$$ into several (possibly, $$$1$$$ or $$$n$$$) non-empty continuous subsegments$$$^{\text{†}}$$$, such that: for each of the subsegments, the set containing all the elements in it is stable.

Master wants Cocoly to partition $$$a$$$ in at least two different$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$ ways. You have to help him determine whether it is possible.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 200$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 200$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5$$$) — the elements in the array $$$a$$$.

For each test case, print $$$\texttt{YES}$$$ if there are at least two ways to partition $$$a$$$, and $$$\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings $$$\texttt{yEs}$$$, $$$\texttt{yes}$$$, $$$\texttt{Yes}$$$, and $$$\texttt{YES}$$$ will be recognized as positive responses.

He wants to forget something, but the white bear phenomenon just keeps hanging over him.

Eric still remembers $$$n$$$ pieces of impressions in the form of an integer array. He records them as $$$w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$$$. However, he has a poor memory of the impressions. For each $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, he can only remember that $$$l_i \leq w_i \leq r_i$$$.

Eric believes that impression $$$i$$$ is unique if and only if there exists a possible array $$$w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$$$ such that $$$w_i \neq w_j$$$ holds for all $$$1 \leq j \leq n$$$ with $$$j \neq i$$$.

Please help Eric determine whether impression $$$i$$$ is unique for every $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, independently for each $$$i$$$. Perhaps your judgment can help rewrite the final story.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of impressions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$: for each $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, if impression $$$i$$$ is unique, $$$s_i=\texttt{1}$$$; otherwise, $$$s_i=\texttt{0}$$$. Do not output spaces.

There are $$$n$$$ stars in the sky, arranged in a row. Iris has a telescope, which she uses to look at the stars.

Initially, Iris observes stars in the segment $$$[1, n]$$$, and she has a lucky value of $$$0$$$. Iris wants to look for the star in the middle position for each segment $$$[l, r]$$$ that she observes. So the following recursive procedure is used:

- First, she will calculate $$$m = \left\lfloor \frac{l+r}{2} \right\rfloor$$$.
- If the length of the segment (i.e. $$$r - l + 1$$$) is even, Iris will divide it into two equally long segments $$$[l, m]$$$ and $$$[m+1, r]$$$ for further observation.
- Otherwise, Iris will aim the telescope at star $$$m$$$, and her lucky value will increase by $$$m$$$; subsequently, if $$$l \neq r$$$, Iris will continue to observe two segments $$$[l, m-1]$$$ and $$$[m+1, r]$$$.

Iris is a bit lazy. She defines her laziness by an integer $$$k$$$: as the observation progresses, she will not continue to observe any segment $$$[l, r]$$$ with a length strictly less than $$$k$$$. In this case, please predict her final lucky value.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^9$$$).

For each test case, output a single integer — the final lucky value.

And like ever before, Iris has set a problem to which she gave a wrong solution, but Chris is always supposed to save it! You are going to play the role of Chris now:

- Chris is given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.
- Iris is interested in the largest possible value of $$$P = \prod\limits_{i=1}^n \min(a_i, b_i)$$$ after an arbitrary rearrangement of $$$b$$$. Note that she only wants to know the maximum value of $$$P$$$, and no actual rearrangement is performed on $$$b$$$.
- There will be $$$q$$$ modifications. Each modification can be denoted by two integers $$$o$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$o$$$ is either $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$, $$$1 \leq x \leq n$$$). If $$$o = 1$$$, then Iris will increase $$$a_x$$$ by $$$1$$$; otherwise, she will increase $$$b_x$$$ by $$$1$$$.
- Iris asks Chris the maximum value of $$$P$$$ for $$$q + 1$$$ times: once before any modification, then after every modification.
- Since $$$P$$$ might be huge, Chris only needs to calculate it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Chris soon worked out this problem, but he was so tired that he fell asleep. Besides saying thanks to Chris, now it is your turn to write a program to calculate the answers for given input data.

Note: since the input and output are large, you may need to optimize them for this problem.

For example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq q \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array and the number of operations.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 5\cdot 10^8$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.

The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i \leq 5\cdot 10^8$$$) — the array $$$b$$$.

Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $$$o$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$o \in \{1, 2\}$$$, $$$1 \leq x \leq n$$$), representing an operation.

It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\cdot 10^5$$$, respectively.

For each test case, output $$$q + 1$$$ integers in a line, representing the answers that Chris will calculate, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: There is a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Let a caterpillar be denoted by an integer pair $$$(p, q)$$$ ($$$1 \leq p, q \leq n$$$, $$$p \neq q$$$): its head is at vertex $$$p$$$, its tail is at vertex $$$q$$$, and it dominates all the vertices on the simple path from $$$p$$$ to $$$q$$$ (including $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$). The caterpillar sequence of $$$(p, q)$$$ is defined as the sequence consisting only of the vertices on the simple path, sorted in the ascending order of the distance to $$$p$$$.

Nora and Aron are taking turns moving the caterpillar, with Nora going first. Both players will be using his or her own optimal strategy:

- They will play to make himself or herself win;
- However, if it is impossible, they will play to prevent the other person from winning (thus, the game will end in a tie).

In Nora's turn, she must choose a vertex $$$u$$$ adjacent to vertex $$$p$$$, which is not dominated by the caterpillar, and move all the vertices in it by one edge towards vertex $$$u$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$. In Aron's turn, he must choose a vertex $$$v$$$ adjacent to vertex $$$q$$$, which is not dominated by the caterpillar, and move all the vertices in it by one edge towards vertex $$$v$$$. Note that the moves allowed to the two players are different.

Whenever $$$p$$$ is a leaf$$$^{\text{†}}$$$, Nora wins$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$. Whenever $$$q$$$ is a leaf, Aron wins. If either initially both $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are leaves, or after $$$10^{100}$$$ turns the game has not ended, the result is a tie.

Please count the number of integer pairs $$$(p, q)$$$ with $$$1 \leq p, q \leq n$$$ and $$$p \neq q$$$ such that, if the caterpillar is initially $$$(p, q)$$$, Aron wins the game.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 2\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The following $$$n - 1$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$), denoting an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of integer pairs $$$(p, q)$$$ which make Aron win.

- $$$\delta$$$: I'm glad my computer had gone out of battery so that I wouldn't have participated in wyrqwq's round and gained a negative delta.
- Felix: [thumbs_up] The problem statement concerning a removed song!
- Aquawave: Do I mourn my Chemistry?
- E.Space: ahh?
- Trine: Bread.
- Iris: So why am I always testing problems?

Time will pass, and we might meet again. Looking back at the past, everybody has lived the life they wanted.

Aquawave has a matrix $$$A$$$ of size $$$n\times m$$$, whose elements can only be integers in the range $$$[1, k]$$$, inclusive. In the matrix, some cells are already filled with an integer, while the rest are currently not filled, denoted by $$$-1$$$.

You are going to fill in all the unfilled places in $$$A$$$. After that, let $$$c_{u,i}$$$ be the number of occurrences of element $$$u$$$ in the $$$i$$$-th row. Aquawave defines the beauty of the matrix as

$$$$$$\sum_{u=1}^k \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} c_{u,i} \cdot c_{u,i+1}.$$$$$$

You have to find the maximum possible beauty of $$$A$$$ after filling in the blanks optimally.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 2\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \leq m \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \cdot m \leq 6\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq n\cdot m$$$) — the number of rows and columns of the matrix $$$A$$$, and the range of the integers in the matrix, respectively.

Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line containing $$$m$$$ integers $$$A_{i,1},A_{i,2},\ldots,A_{i,m}$$$ ($$$1 \leq A_{i,j} \leq k$$$ or $$$A_{i,j} = -1$$$) — the elements in $$$A$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$6\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible beauty.

Formally, Iris has an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, where each number in the sequence is between $$$1$$$ and $$$w$$$, inclusive. It is guaranteed that $$$w \geq 2$$$.

Iris defines an operation as selecting two numbers $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ satisfying $$$a_i = a_{i+1}$$$, and then changing them to two arbitrary integers within the range $$$[1, w]$$$. Iris does not like equality, so she must guarantee that $$$a_i \neq a_{i+1}$$$ after the operation. Two identical pairs $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ can be selected multiple times.

Iris wants to know the maximum possible sum of all elements of $$$a$$$ after several (possible, zero) operations, as well as the minimum number of operations required to achieve this maximum value.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to compute the minimum length of the arrays. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Iris treasures an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. She knows this array has an interesting property: the maximum absolute value of all elements is less than or equal to the sum of all elements, that is, $$$\max(\lvert a_i\rvert) \leq \sum a_i$$$.

Iris defines the boredom of an array as its maximum subarray$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ sum.

Iris's birthday is coming, and Victor is going to send her another array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ as a gift. For some seemingly obvious reasons, he decides the array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ should have the following properties.

- $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ should be a subsequence$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$.
- The two arrays have the same sum. That is, $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m b_i$$$.
- The boredom of $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ is the smallest possible.
- Among the arrays with the smallest boredom, the length of the array $$$b$$$ (i.e., $$$m$$$) is the smallest possible. And in this case, Iris will understand his regard as soon as possible!

Even constrained as above, there are still too many possible gifts. So Victor asks you to compute the value of $$$\boldsymbol{m}$$$ of any array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ satisfying all the conditions above. He promises you: if you help him successfully, he will share a bit of Iris's birthday cake with you.

- The two arrays have the same sum. That is, $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m b_i$$$.
- The boredom of $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ is the smallest possible.
- Among the arrays with the smallest boredom, the length of the array $$$b$$$ (i.e., $$$m$$$) is the smallest possible. And in this case, Iris will understand his regard as soon as possible!

For a possible array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ satisfying all the conditions above, Victor defines the value of the array as the number of occurrences of array $$$a$$$ as subsequences in array $$$b$$$. That is, he counts the number of array $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n}$$$ that $$$1\le c_1< c_2< \ldots< c_n\le m$$$ and for all integer $$$i$$$ that $$$1\le i\le n$$$, $$$b_{c_{i}}=a_i$$$ is satisfied, and let this be the value of array $$$b$$$.

Even constrained as above, there are still too many possible gifts. So Victor asks you to calculate the sum of value of all possible arrays $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$. Since the answer may be large, Victor only needs the number modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$. He promises you: if you help him successfully, he will share a bit of Iris's birthday cake with you.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 3\cdot 10^6$$$) — the length of the array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial array. It is guaranteed that $$$\max(\lvert a_i\rvert) \leq \sum a_i$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3\cdot 10^6$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the sum of values of valid arrays $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You have some cards. An integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ is written on each card: specifically, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you have $$$a_i$$$ cards which have the number $$$i$$$ written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have $$$k$$$ coins, so you can buy at most $$$k$$$ new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between $$$\mathbf{1}$$$ and $$$\mathbf{n}$$$, inclusive.

After buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules:

- all the decks must have the same size;
- there are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck.

Find the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq k \leq 10^{16}$$$) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 10^{10}$$$, $$$\sum a_i \geq 1$$$) — the number of cards of type $$$i$$$ you have at the beginning, for each $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible size of a deck if you operate optimally.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. In the three versions, the constraints on $$$n$$$ and the time limit are different. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.

This is the statement of Problem D1B:

- There are $$$n$$$ cities in a row, numbered $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$ left to right.  At time $$$1$$$, you conquer exactly one city, called the starting city.  At time $$$2, 3, \ldots, n$$$, you can choose a city adjacent to the ones conquered so far and conquer it. You win if, for each $$$i$$$, you conquer city $$$i$$$ at a time no later than $$$a_i$$$. A winning strategy may or may not exist, also depending on the starting city. How many starting cities allow you to win?

For each $$$0 \leq k \leq n$$$, count the number of arrays of positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ such that

- $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$ for each $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$;
- the answer to Problem D1B is $$$k$$$.

The answer can be very large, so you have to calculate it modulo a given prime $$$p$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 80$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 80$$$, $$$10^8 \leq p \leq 10^9$$$, $$$p$$$ is prime) — the number of cities and the modulo.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$80$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n+1$$$ integers: the $$$i$$$-th integer should be the number of arrays that satisfy the conditions for $$$k = i-1$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Amidst skyscrapers in the bustling metropolis of Metro Manila, the newest Noiph mall in the Philippines has just been completed! The construction manager, Penchick, ordered a state-of-the-art monument to be built with $$$n$$$ pillars.

The heights of the monument's pillars can be represented as an array $$$h$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers, where $$$h_i$$$ represents the height of the $$$i$$$-th pillar for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$.

Penchick wants the heights of the pillars to be in non-decreasing order, i.e. $$$h_i \le h_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n - 1$$$. However, due to confusion, the monument was built such that the heights of the pillars are in non-increasing order instead, i.e. $$$h_i \ge h_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n - 1$$$.

Luckily, Penchick can modify the monument and do the following operation on the pillars as many times as necessary:

- Modify the height of a pillar to any positive integer. Formally, choose an index $$$1\le i\le n$$$ and a positive integer $$$x$$$. Then, assign $$$h_i := x$$$.

Help Penchick determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the heights of the monument's pillars non-decreasing.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 50$$$) — the number of pillars.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \le h_i \le n$$$ and $$$h_i\ge h_{i+1}$$$) — the height of the pillars.

Please take note that the given array $$$h$$$ is non-increasing.

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make the heights of the pillars non-decreasing.

In the bustling food stalls of Surabaya, Kohane bought $$$n$$$ satay sticks and arranged them in a line, with the $$$i$$$-th satay stick having length $$$p_i$$$. It is given that $$$p$$$ is a permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of length $$$n$$$.

Penchick wants to sort the satay sticks in increasing order of length, so that $$$p_i=i$$$ for each $$$1\le i\le n$$$. For fun, they created a rule: they can only swap neighboring satay sticks whose lengths differ by exactly $$$1$$$. Formally, they can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n-1$$$) such that $$$|p_{i+1}-p_i|=1$$$;
- Swap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$.

Determine whether it is possible to sort the permutation $$$p$$$, thus the satay sticks, by performing the above operation.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of satay sticks.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$ representing the length of the satay sticks.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to sort permutation $$$p$$$ by performing the operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

For his birthday, Kohane wants to combine them with a gift: $$$n$$$ BBQ buns arranged from left to right. There are $$$10^6$$$ available fillings of BBQ buns, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^6$$$. To ensure that Penchick would love this gift, Kohane has a few goals:

- No filling is used exactly once; that is, each filling must either not appear at all or appear at least twice.
- For any two buns $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ that have the same filling, the distance between them, which is $$$|i-j|$$$, must be a perfect square$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$.

Help Kohane find a valid way to choose the filling of the buns, or determine if it is impossible to satisfy her goals! If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of BBQ buns.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, if no valid choice of fillings exists, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th integer represents the filling of the $$$i$$$-th BBQ bun. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

While trekking along a linear oasis, Penchick spots a desert rabbit preparing to jump along a line of palm trees. There are $$$n$$$ trees, each with a height denoted by $$$a_i$$$.

The rabbit can jump from the $$$i$$$-th tree to the $$$j$$$-th tree if exactly one of the following conditions is true:

- $$$j < i$$$ and $$$a_j > a_i$$$: the rabbit can jump backward to a taller tree.
- $$$j > i$$$ and $$$a_j < a_i$$$: the rabbit can jump forward to a shorter tree.

For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, determine the maximum height among all trees that the rabbit can reach if it starts from the $$$i$$$-th tree.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of trees.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the height of the trees.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should contain the maximum height among all trees that the rabbit can reach if it starts from the $$$i$$$-th tree.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: With just a few hours left until Penchick and Chloe leave for Singapore, they could hardly wait to see the towering trees at the Singapore Botanic Gardens! Attempting to contain their excitement, Penchick crafted a rooted tree to keep Chloe and himself busy.

Penchick has a rooted tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, with vertex $$$1$$$ as the root, and Chloe can select a non-negative integer $$$d$$$ to create a perfect binary tree$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of depth $$$d$$$.

Since Penchick and Chloe are good friends, Chloe wants her tree to be isomorphic$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$ to Penchick's tree. To meet this condition, Chloe can perform the following operation on her own tree any number of times:

- Select an edge $$$(u,v)$$$, where $$$u$$$ is the parent of $$$v$$$.
- Remove vertex $$$v$$$ and all the edges connected to $$$v$$$, then connect all of $$$v$$$'s previous children directly to $$$u$$$.

In particular, doing an operation on an edge $$$(u, v)$$$ where $$$v$$$ is a leaf will delete vertex $$$v$$$ without adding any new edges.

Since constructing a perfect binary tree can be time-consuming, Chloe wants to choose the minimum $$$d$$$ such that a perfect binary tree of depth $$$d$$$ can be made isomorphic to Penchick's tree using the above operation. Note that she can't change the roots of the trees.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^6$$$) — the number of vertices in Penchick's tree.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq i-1$$$) — the parent of vertex $$$i$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer on each line: the minimum depth of Chloe's perfect binary tree.

Returning from a restful vacation on Australia's Gold Coast, Penchick forgot to bring home gifts for his pet duck Duong Canh! But perhaps a beautiful problem crafted through deep thought on the scenic beaches could be the perfect souvenir.

There is a hidden permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$n$$$ is even. You are allowed to make the following query:

- Choose a subsequence$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of the permutation $$$p$$$ with even length $$$4\le k\le n$$$. The interactor will return the value of the two medians$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$ in the chosen subsequence.

Find the index of the two medians in permutation $$$p$$$ using at most $$$80$$$ queries.

Note that the interactor is non-adaptive. This means that the permutation $$$p$$$ is fixed at the beginning and will not change based on your queries.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$6 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$n$$$ is even) — the length of the hidden permutation $$$p$$$.

For each test case, after reading the integer $$$n$$$, you should begin the interaction and find the answer before reading $$$n$$$ for the next test case.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

- Each card has an integer value between $$$1$$$ and $$$10$$$.
- Each player receives $$$2$$$ cards which are face-down (so a player doesn't know their cards).
- The game is turn-based and consists exactly of two turns. In a round, both players pick a random unflipped card and flip it. The player who flipped a card with a strictly greater number wins the round. In case of equality, no one wins the round.
- A player wins a game if he wins the most number of rounds (i.e. strictly greater than the other player). In case of equality, no one wins the game.

Since Suneet and Slavic aren't best friends, you need to calculate the number of ways the game could happen that Suneet would end up as the winner.

For a better understanding, please check the notes section.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains $$$4$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$b_1$$$, $$$b_2$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 \leq 10$$$) where $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_2$$$ represent the cards Suneet has, and $$$b_1$$$ and $$$b_2$$$ represent the cards Slavic has, respectively.

There exists a string $$$s$$$, which consists of lowercase English letters and possibly zero or more "?".

Slavic is asked to change each "?" to a lowercase English letter such that string $$$t$$$ becomes a subsequence (not necessarily continuous) of the string $$$s$$$.

Output any such string, or say that it is impossible in case no string that respects the conditions exists.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \leq T \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, and $$$s$$$ consists only of lowercase English letters and "?"-s)  – the original string you have.

The second line of each test case contains a single string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq |t| \leq |s|$$$, and $$$t$$$ consists only of lowercase English letters)  – the string that should be a subsequence of string $$$s$$$.

The sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$x$$$.

For each test case, if no such string exists as described in the statement, output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string that respects all conditions.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Arul has a binary array$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.

He will take all subsequences$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of length $$$k$$$ ($$$k$$$ is odd) of this array and find their median.$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$

What is the sum of all these values?

As this sum can be very large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. In other words, print the remainder of this sum when divided by $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k$$$ is odd) — the length of the array and the length of the subsequence, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 1$$$) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print the sum modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is that in this version, you can make at most $$$\mathbf{10}$$$ queries.

This is an interactive problem. If you are unsure how interactive problems work, then it is recommended to read the guide for participants.

We have a secret ruler that is missing one number $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \leq x \leq 999$$$). When you measure an object of length $$$y$$$, the ruler reports the following values:

- If $$$y < x$$$, the ruler (correctly) measures the object as having length $$$y$$$.
- If $$$y \geq x$$$, the ruler incorrectly measures the object as having length $$$y+1$$$.

The ruler above is missing the number $$$4$$$, so it correctly measures the first segment as length $$$3$$$ but incorrectly measures the second segment as length $$$6$$$ even though it is actually $$$5$$$.

You need to find the value of $$$x$$$. To do that, you can make queries of the following form:

- $$$\texttt{?}~a~b$$$ — in response, we will measure the side lengths of an $$$a \times b$$$ rectangle with our ruler and multiply the results, reporting the measured area of the rectangle back to you. For example, if $$$x=4$$$ and you query a $$$3 \times 5$$$ rectangle, we will measure its side lengths as $$$3 \times 6$$$ and report $$$18$$$ back to you.

Find the value of $$$x$$$. You can ask at most $$$\mathbf{10}$$$ queries.

The integer $$$n$$$ had the form $$$\text{10^x}$$$ ($$$x \ge 2$$$), where the symbol '$$$\text{^}$$$' denotes exponentiation.. Something went wrong, and Dmitry missed the symbol '$$$\text{^}$$$' when writing the important integer. For example, instead of the integer $$$10^5$$$, he would have written $$$105$$$, and instead of $$$10^{19}$$$, he would have written $$$1019$$$.

Dmitry wants to understand which of the integers on the board could have been the important integer and which could not.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of integers on the board.

The next $$$t$$$ lines each contain an integer $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \le a \le 10000$$$) — the next integer from the board.

For each integer on the board, output "YES" if it could have been the important integer and "NO" otherwise.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: In Berland, a bus consists of a row of $$$n$$$ seats numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Passengers are advised to always board the bus following these rules:

- If there are no occupied seats in the bus, a passenger can sit in any free seat;
- Otherwise, a passenger should sit in any free seat that has at least one occupied neighboring seat. In other words, a passenger can sit in a seat with index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) only if at least one of the seats with indices $$$i-1$$$ or $$$i+1$$$ is occupied.

Today, $$$n$$$ passengers boarded the bus. The array $$$a$$$ chronologically records the seat numbers they occupied. That is, $$$a_1$$$ contains the seat number where the first passenger sat, $$$a_2$$$ — the seat number where the second passenger sat, and so on.

You know the contents of the array $$$a$$$. Determine whether all passengers followed the recommendations.

For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and $$$a$$$ = [$$$5, 4, 2, 1, 3$$$], then the recommendations were not followed, as the $$$3$$$-rd passenger sat in seat number $$$2$$$, while the neighboring seats with numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ were free.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The following describes the input test cases.

The first line of each test case contains exactly one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of seats in the bus and the number of passengers who boarded the bus.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the seats that the passengers occupied in chronological order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ values across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$, and that no passenger sits in an already occupied seat.

For each test case, output on a separate line:

- "YES", if all passengers followed the recommendations;
- "NO" otherwise.

You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

She also has $$$m$$$ strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The strings are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. She wants to check which strings match the template.

A string $$$s$$$ is considered to match the template if all of the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied:

- The length of the string $$$s$$$ is equal to the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.
- The same numbers from $$$a$$$ correspond to the same symbols from $$$s$$$. So, if $$$a_i = a_j$$$, then $$$s_i = s_j$$$ for ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$).
- The same symbols from $$$s$$$ correspond to the same numbers from $$$a$$$. So, if $$$s_i = s_j$$$, then $$$a_i = a_j$$$ for ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$).

For example, if $$$a$$$ = [$$$3, 5, 2, 1, 3$$$], then the string "abfda" matches the template, while the string "afbfa" does not, since the character "f" corresponds to both numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The following descriptions are for the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.

The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

The third line of each test case contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of strings to check for template matching.

Following are $$$m$$$ strings, each containing a non-empty string $$$s_j$$$ ($$$1 \le |s_j| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$, and that the sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$m$$$ lines. On the $$$i$$$-th line ($$$1 \le i \le m$$$) output:

- "YES", if the string with index $$$i$$$ matches the template;
- "NO" otherwise.

You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Vlad found a strip of $$$n$$$ cells, numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In the $$$i$$$-th cell, there is a positive integer $$$a_i$$$ and a letter $$$s_i$$$, where all $$$s_i$$$ are either 'L' or 'R'.

Vlad invites you to try to score the maximum possible points by performing any (possibly zero) number of operations.

In one operation, you can choose two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l < r \le n$$$) such that $$$s_l$$$ = 'L' and $$$s_r$$$ = 'R' and do the following:

- add $$$a_l + a_{l + 1} + \dots + a_{r - 1} + a_r$$$ points to the current score;
- replace $$$s_i$$$ with '.' for all $$$l \le i \le r$$$, meaning you can no longer choose these indices.

For example, consider the following strip:

$$$3$$$$$$5$$$$$$1$$$$$$4$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$LRLLLR

You can first choose $$$l = 1$$$, $$$r = 2$$$ and add $$$3 + 5 = 8$$$ to your score.

$$$3$$$$$$5$$$$$$1$$$$$$4$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$..LLLR

Then choose $$$l = 3$$$, $$$r = 6$$$ and add $$$1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 10$$$ to your score.

$$$3$$$$$$5$$$$$$1$$$$$$4$$$$$$3$$$$$$2$$$......

As a result, it is impossible to perform another operation, and the final score is $$$18$$$.

What is the maximum score that can be achieved?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^5$$$) — the numbers written on the strip.

The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output one integer — the maximum possible number of points that can be scored.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You really love gorillas, so you decided to organize a photoshoot for them. Gorillas live in the jungle. The jungle is represented as a grid of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. $$$w$$$ gorillas agreed to participate in the photoshoot, and the gorilla with index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le w$$$) has a height of $$$a_i$$$. You want to place all the gorillas in the cells of the grid such that there is no more than one gorilla in each cell.

The spectacle of the arrangement is equal to the sum of the spectacles of all sub-squares of the grid with a side length of $$$k$$$.

The spectacle of a sub-square is equal to the sum of the heights of the gorillas in it.

From all suitable arrangements, choose the arrangement with the maximum spectacle.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.

The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le n \cdot m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le k \le \min(n, m)$$$) — the dimensions of the grid and the side length of the square.

The second line contains an integer $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \le w \le n \cdot m$$$) — the number of gorillas.

The third line contains $$$w$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_w$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the heights of the gorillas.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. The same guarantee applies to $$$w$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum spectacle of a suitable arrangement.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You have $$$n$$$ rectangles, the $$$i$$$-th of which has a width of $$$a_i$$$ and a height of $$$b_i$$$.

You can perform the following operation an unlimited number of times: choose a rectangle and a cell in it, and then color it.

Each time you completely color any row or column, you earn $$$1$$$ point. Your task is to score at least $$$k$$$ points with as few operations as possible.

Suppose you have a rectangle with a width of $$$6$$$ and a height of $$$3$$$. You can score $$$4$$$ points by coloring all the cells in any $$$4$$$ columns, thus performing $$$12$$$ operations.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The following are the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000, 1 \le k \le 100$$$) — the number of rectangles in the case and the required number of points.

The next $$$n$$$ lines contain the descriptions of the rectangles. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le 100$$$) — the width and height of the $$$i$$$-th rectangle.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to score at least $$$k$$$ points. If it is impossible to score at least $$$k$$$ points, output -1.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You live in a city consisting of $$$n$$$ intersections and $$$m$$$ streets connecting some pairs of intersections. You can travel in either direction on each street. No two streets connect the same pair of intersections, and no street connects an intersection to itself. You can reach any intersection from any other, possibly passing through some other intersections.

Every minute, you can board a bus at intersection $$$u_i$$$ and travel for $$$l_{i1}$$$ minutes to intersection $$$v_i$$$. Conversely, you can travel from intersection $$$v_i$$$ to intersection $$$u_i$$$ in $$$l_{i1}$$$ minutes. You can only board and exit the bus at intersections. You can only board the bus at an intersection if you are currently there.

You can also walk along each street, which takes $$$l_{i2} > l_{i1}$$$ minutes.

You can make stops at intersections.

You live at intersection number $$$1$$$. Today you woke up at time $$$0$$$, and you have an important event scheduled at intersection number $$$n$$$, which you must reach no later than time $$$t_0$$$. You also have a phone call planned that will last from $$$t_1$$$ to $$$t_2$$$ minutes ($$$t_1 < t_2 < t_0$$$).

During the phone call, you cannot ride the bus, but you can walk along any streets, make stops, or stay at home. You can exit the bus at minute $$$t_1$$$ and board the bus again at minute $$$t_2$$$.

Since you want to get enough sleep, you became curious — how late can you leave home to have time to talk on the phone and still not be late for the event?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following are the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^5$$$) — the number of intersections and streets in the city.

The second line of each test case contains three integers $$$t_0$$$, $$$t_1$$$, $$$t_2$$$ ($$$1 \le t_1 < t_2 < t_0 \le 10^9$$$) — the start time of the event, the start time of the phone call, and its end time, respectively.

The next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case contain descriptions of the streets.

The $$$i$$$-th line contains four integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, $$$l_{i1}$$$, $$$l_{i2}$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$, $$$1 \le l_{i1} < l_{i2} \le 10^9$$$) — the numbers of the intersections connected by the $$$i$$$-th street, as well as the travel time along the street by bus and on foot. It is guaranteed that no two streets connect the same pair of intersections and that it is possible to reach any intersection from any other.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the latest time you can leave home to have time to talk on the phone and not be late for the event. If you cannot reach the event on time, output -1.

To stand out among competitors and achieve success, she decided to write her own game engine. The engine must support a set initially consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.

The set will undergo $$$m$$$ operations sequentially. The operations can be of the following types:

- Insert element $$$x$$$ into the set;
- Remove element $$$x$$$ from the set;
- Report the $$$k$$$-load of the set.

The $$$k$$$-load of the set is defined as the minimum positive integer $$$d$$$ such that the integers $$$d, d + 1, \ldots, d + (k - 1)$$$ do not appear in this set. For example, the $$$3$$$-load of the set $$$\{3, 4, 6, 11\}$$$ is $$$7$$$, since the integers $$$7, 8, 9$$$ are absent from the set, and no smaller value fits.

Ksyusha is busy with management tasks, so you will have to write the engine. Implement efficient support for the described operations.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The following lines describe the test cases.

The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the initial size of the set.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the initial state of the set.

The third line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of operations.

The next $$$m$$$ lines contain the operations. The operations are given in the following format:

- + $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — insert element $$$x$$$ into the set (it is guaranteed that $$$x$$$ is not in the set);
- - $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — remove element $$$x$$$ from the set (it is guaranteed that $$$x$$$ is in the set);
- ? $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — output the value of the $$$k$$$-load of the set.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$, and the same holds for $$$m$$$.

For each test case, output the answers to the operations of type "?".

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: One day, the schoolboy Mark misbehaved, so the teacher Sasha called him to the whiteboard.

Sasha gave Mark a table with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. His task is to arrange the numbers $$$0, 1, \ldots, n \cdot m - 1$$$ in the table (each number must be used exactly once) in such a way as to maximize the sum of MEX$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ across all rows and columns. More formally, he needs to maximize $$$$$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \operatorname{mex}(\{a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \ldots, a_{i,m}\}) + \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{m} \operatorname{mex}(\{a_{1,j}, a_{2,j}, \ldots, a_{n,j}\}),$$$$$$ where $$$a_{i,j}$$$ is the number in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column.

Sasha is not interested in how Mark arranges the numbers, so he only asks him to state one number — the maximum sum of MEX across all rows and columns that can be achieved.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 10^9$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the table, respectively.

For each test case, output the maximum possible sum of $$$\operatorname{mex}$$$ across all rows and columns.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Due to a shortage of teachers in the senior class of the "T-generation", it was decided to have a huge male gorilla conduct exams for the students. However, it is not that simple; to prove his competence, he needs to solve the following problem.

For an array $$$b$$$, we define the function $$$f(b)$$$ as the smallest number of the following operations required to make the array $$$b$$$ empty:

- take two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, such that $$$l \le r$$$, and let $$$x$$$ be the $$$\min(b_l, b_{l+1}, \ldots, b_r)$$$; then
- remove all such $$$b_i$$$ that $$$l \le i \le r$$$ and $$$b_i = x$$$ from the array, the deleted elements are removed, the indices are renumerated.

You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. No more than $$$k$$$ times, you can choose any index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) and any integer $$$p$$$, and replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$p$$$.

Help the gorilla to determine the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$ that can be achieved after such replacements.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le k \le n$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the maximum number of changes, respectively.

The second line of each set of input data contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$ itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all sets of input data does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each set of input data, output a single integer on a separate line — the smallest possible value of $$$f(a)$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: In the upcoming year, there will be many team olympiads, so the teachers of "T-generation" need to assemble a team of three pupils to participate in them. Any three pupils will show a worthy result in any team olympiad. But winning the olympiad is only half the battle; first, you need to get there...

Each pupil has an independence level, expressed as an integer. In "T-generation", there is exactly one student with each independence levels from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$, inclusive. For a team of three pupils with independence levels $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, the value of their team independence is equal to $$$(a \oplus b) + (b \oplus c) + (a \oplus c)$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

Your task is to choose any trio of students with the maximum possible team independence.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case set contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$0 \le l, r < 2^{30}$$$, $$$r - l > 1$$$) — the minimum and maximum independence levels of the students.

For each test case set, output three pairwise distinct integers $$$a, b$$$, and $$$c$$$, such that $$$l \le a, b, c \le r$$$ and the value of the expression $$$(a \oplus b) + (b \oplus c) + (a \oplus c)$$$ is maximized. If there are multiple triples with the maximum value, any of them can be output.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: "T-Generation" has decided to purchase gifts for various needs; thus, they have $$$n$$$ different sweaters numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th sweater has a size of $$$a_i$$$. Now they need to send some subsegment of sweaters to an olympiad. It is necessary that the sweaters fit as many people as possible, but without having to take too many of them.

They need to choose two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) to maximize the convenience equal to $$$$$$\operatorname{max} (a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r) - \operatorname{min} (a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r) - (r - l),$$$$$$ that is, the range of sizes minus the number of sweaters.

Sometimes the sizes of the sweaters change; it is known that there have been $$$q$$$ changes, in each change, the size of the $$$p$$$-th sweater becomes $$$x$$$.

Help the "T-Generation" team and determine the maximum convenience among all possible pairs $$$(l, r)$$$ initially, as well as after each size change.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of sweaters and the number of size changes.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the sizes of the sweaters.

Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines of each test case contains two integers $$$p$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le p \le n$$$, $$$1 \le x \le 10^9$$$) — the next size change.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ and the sum of the values of $$$q$$$ across all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the maximum value of convenience among all possible pairs $$$(l, r)$$$ before any actions, as well as after each size change.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: One day, the teachers of "T-generation" decided to instill discipline in the pupils, so they lined them up and made them calculate in order. There are a total of $$$n$$$ pupils, the height of the $$$i$$$-th pupil in line is $$$a_i$$$.

The line is comfortable, if for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, the following condition holds: $$$a_i \cdot 2 \ge a_{i + 1}$$$. Initially, the line is comfortable.

The teachers do not like that the maximum height in the line is too small, so they want to feed the pupils pizza. You know that when a pupil eats one pizza, their height increases by $$$1$$$. One pizza can only be eaten by only one pupil, but each pupil can eat an unlimited number of pizzas. It is important that after all the pupils have eaten their pizzas, the line is comfortable.

The teachers have $$$q$$$ options for how many pizzas they will order. For each option $$$k_i$$$, answer the question: what is the maximum height $$$\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$$$ that can be achieved if the pupils eat at most $$$k_i$$$ pizzas.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each set of test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of pupils and the number of options for how many pizzas the teachers will order.

The second line of each set of test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the heights of the pupils.It is guaranteed that initially, the line is comfortable.

Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines of each set of input data contains one integer $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \le k_i \le 10^9$$$) — the next limit for how many pizzas the pupils can eat.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all sets of input data does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^4$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$q$$$ across all sets of input data does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^4$$$.

For each test case, for each limit for how many pizzas the pupils can eat, output the maximum value $$$\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$$$ that can be achieved while ensuring that the line is comfortable.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Every Saturday, Alexander B., a teacher of parallel X, writes a secret message to Alexander G., a teacher of parallel B, in the evening. Since Alexander G. is giving a lecture at that time and the message is very important, Alexander B. has to write this message on an interactive online board.

The interactive online board is a grid consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, where each cell is $$$1 \times 1$$$ in size. Some cells of this board are already filled in, and it is impossible to write a message in them; such cells are marked with the symbol ".", while the remaining cells are called free and are marked with the symbol "#".

Let us introduce two characteristics of the online board:

- $$$s$$$ is the number of free cells.
- $$$p$$$ is the perimeter of the grid figure formed by the union of free cells.

Let $$$A$$$ be the set of free cells. Your goal is to find a set of cells $$$S \subseteq A$$$ that satisfies the following properties:

- $$$|S| \le \frac{1}{5} \cdot (s+p)$$$.
- Any cell from $$$A$$$ either lies in $$$S$$$ or shares a side with some cell from $$$S$$$.

We can show that at least one set $$$S$$$ satisfying these properties exists; you are required to find any suitable one.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains the number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 80\,000$$$) — the number of test cases.

In the first line of each test case, the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the dimensions of the grid are given.

The following $$$n$$$ lines contain the description of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^6$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n$$$ lines consisting of $$$m$$$ symbols, where each symbol encodes the state of the cell:

- "#" — the cell is in $$$A$$$ but not in $$$S$$$;
- "S" — the cell is in both $$$A$$$ and $$$S$$$;
- "." — the cell is neither in $$$A$$$ nor in $$$S$$$.

In one day, you need to have time to analyze the training and thematic contests, give a lecture with new material, and, if possible, also hold a mini-seminar. Therefore, there is a break where students can go to drink coffee and chat with each other.

There are a total of $$$n+2$$$ coffee machines located in sequentially arranged rooms along a long corridor. The coffee machines are numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n+1$$$, and immediately after the break starts, there are $$$a_i$$$ students gathered around the $$$i$$$-th coffee machine.

The students are talking too loudly among themselves, and the teachers need to make a very important announcement. Therefore, they want to gather the maximum number of students around some single coffee machine. The teachers are too lazy to run around the corridors and gather the students, so they came up with a more sophisticated way to manipulate them:

- At any moment, the teachers can choose room $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) and turn off the lights there;
- If there were $$$x$$$ students in that room, then after turning off the lights, $$$\lfloor \frac12 x \rfloor$$$ students will go to room $$$(i-1)$$$, and $$$\lfloor \frac12 x \rfloor$$$ other students will go to room $$$(i+1)$$$.
- If $$$x$$$ was odd, then one student remains in the same room.
- After that, the lights in room $$$i$$$ are turned back on.

The teachers have not yet decided where they will gather the students, so for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you should determine what is the maximum number of students that can be gathered around the $$$i$$$-th coffee machine.

The teachers can turn off the lights in any rooms at their discretion, in any order, possibly turning off the lights in the same room multiple times.

Note that the values of $$$a_0$$$ and $$$a_{n+1}$$$ do not affect the answer to the problem, so their values will not be given to you.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10\,000$$$) — the number of test cases.

In the first line of each test case, there is an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$).

In the second line of each test case, there are integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the number of students around coffee machines numbered $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, \ldots, b_n$$$, where $$$b_i$$$ is the maximum number of students that can be around coffee machines number $$$i$$$.

You are given an array $$$x_1, \ldots, x_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The jury also has a fixed but hidden array $$$y_1, \ldots, y_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The elements of array $$$y$$$ are unknown to you. Additionally, it is known that for all $$$i$$$, $$$x_i \neq y_i$$$, and all pairs $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are distinct.

The jury has secretly thought of one of two objects, and you need to determine which one it is:

- Object A: A directed graph with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and with $$$n$$$ edges of the form $$$x_i \to y_i$$$.
- Object B: $$$n$$$ points on a coordinate plane. The $$$i$$$-th point has coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$.

To guess which object the jury has thought of, you can make queries. In one query, you must specify two numbers $$$i, j$$$ $$$(1 \leq i, j \leq n, i \neq j)$$$. In response, you receive one number:

- If the jury has thought of Object A, you receive the length of the shortest path (in edges) from vertex $$$i$$$ to vertex $$$j$$$ in the graph, or $$$0$$$ if there is no path.
- If the jury has thought of Object B, you receive the Manhattan distance between points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, that is $$$|x_i -x_j| + |y_i - y_j|$$$.

You have $$$2$$$ queries to determine which of the objects the jury has thought of.

You need to process all the numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, in the order from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. When processing the next $$$a_i$$$, you must perform exactly one of the three actions of your choice:

1. $$$P := P \oplus a_i$$$

$$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

When performing actions, you must follow the main rule: it is necessary that after each action, all three numbers $$$P,Q,R$$$ are not pairwise distinct.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, all $$$a_i = 0$$$. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

There is an $$$n$$$-story building, with floors numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from bottom to top. There is exactly one person living on each floor.

All the residents of the building have a very important goal today: to launch at least $$$c$$$ paper airplanes collectively. The residents will launch the airplanes in turn. When a person from the $$$i$$$-th floor launches an airplane, all residents on the floors from $$$1$$$ to $$$i$$$ can see it as it descends to the ground.

If, from the perspective of the resident on the $$$i$$$-th floor, at least $$$c$$$ airplanes have already been launched, they will not launch any more airplanes themselves. It is also known that by the end of the day, from the perspective of each resident in the building, at least $$$c$$$ airplanes have been launched, and a total of $$$m$$$ airplanes were thrown.

You carefully monitored this flash mob and recorded which resident from which floor threw each airplane. Unfortunately, the information about who exactly threw some airplanes has been lost. Find the number of ways to fill in the gaps so that the information could be credible. Since the answer can be quite large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

In this version of the problem, all information has been lost, and the entire array consists of gaps.

It is also possible that you made a mistake in your records, and there is no possible way to restore the gaps. In that case, the answer is considered to be $$$0$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n, c, m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$1 \le c \le 100$$$, $$$c \le m \le n \cdot c$$$) — the number of floors in the building, the minimum required number of airplanes, and the number of airplanes actually launched.

The second line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le n$$$) — $$$a_i$$$ indicates the resident from which floor launched the $$$i$$$-th airplane; $$$a_i = 0$$$ indicates a gap.

In this version of the problem, it is guaranteed that all $$$a_i = 0$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

For each test case, output the number of ways to fill in the gaps with numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, so that the chronology of the airplane launches could be credible, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You have $$$n$$$ barrels of infinite capacity. The $$$i$$$-th barrel initially contains $$$a_i$$$ kilograms of water. In this problem, we assume that all barrels weigh the same.

You know that exactly one of the barrels has a small amount of tropical poison distributed on its surface, with a total weight of $$$0.179$$$ kilograms. However, you do not know which barrel contains the poison. Your task is to identify this poisonous barrel.

All the barrels are on scales. Unfortunately, the scales do not show the exact weight of each barrel. Instead, for each pair of barrels, they show the result of a comparison between the weights of those barrels. Thus, for any two barrels, you can determine whether their weights are equal, and if not, which barrel is heavier. The poison and water are included in the weight of the barrel.

The scales are always turned on, and the information from them can be used an unlimited number of times.

You also have the ability to pour water. You can pour water from any barrel into any other barrel in any amounts.

However, to pour water, you must physically handle the barrel from which you are pouring, so if that happens to be the poisonous barrel, you will die. This outcome must be avoided.

However, you can pour water into the poisonous barrel without touching it.

In other words, you can choose the numbers $$$i, j, x$$$ ($$$i \neq j, 1 \leq i, j \leq n, 0 < x \leq a_i$$$, the barrel numbered $$$i$$$ — not is poisonous) and execute $$$a_i := a_i - x$$$, $$$a_j := a_j + x$$$. Where $$$x$$$ is not necessarily an integer.

Is it possible to guarantee the identification of which barrel contains the poison and remain alive using pouring and the information from the scales? You know that the poison is located on exactly one of the barrels.

Additionally, we ask you to process $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, either one of the existing barrels is removed, or an additional barrel with a certain amount of water is added. After each query, you need to answer whether it is possible to guarantee the identification of the poisonous barrel, given that there is exactly one.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^6$$$) — the volumes of water in the existing barrels.

The next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is either of the form + x or - x, which means, respectively, adding and removing a barrel with $$$x$$$ kilograms of water. It is guaranteed that when the query - x is made, one of the existing barrels has a volume of $$$x$$$, and that there is always at least one barrel remaining throughout the queries. In all queries, $$$1 \leq x \leq 10^6$$$.

Output $$$q+1$$$ lines, the answer to the problem before all queries, and after each query. If it is possible to identify the poisonous barrel, output "Yes"; otherwise, output "No". You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

If it is possible, you need to construct any possible sequence of operations. Constraint: in your answer, the sum of the lengths of the arrays used as replacements must not exceed $$$n + m$$$ across all operations. The numbers must not exceed $$$10^9$$$ in absolute value.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 200$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 500$$$) — the lengths of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

For each test case, output $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to transform array $$$a$$$ into array $$$b$$$.

Otherwise, in the first line, output the number of operations $$$0 \leq q \leq n + m$$$. Then output the operations in the following format in the order they are performed.

In the first line of each operation, print three numbers $$$l, r, k$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq |a|$$$). In the second line, print $$$k$$$ integers $$$c_1 \ldots c_k$$$, which means replacing the segment $$$a_l, \ldots, a_r$$$ with the array $$$c_1, \ldots, c_k$$$.

The sum of $$$k$$$ across all $$$q$$$ operations must not exceed $$$n + m$$$. Additionally, it must hold that $$$-10^9 \leq c_i \leq 10^9$$$.

In other words, all other points from the set have distance to $$$j$$$ greater or equal to $$$|i - j|$$$.

For example, consider a set of points $$$\{1, 3, 5, 8\}$$$:

- for the point $$$3$$$, there are two closest points: $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$;
- for the point $$$5$$$, the closest point is $$$3$$$ (but not $$$8$$$, since its distance is greater than $$$|3-5|$$$);
- for the point $$$8$$$, the closest point is $$$5$$$.

You are given a set of points. You have to add an integer point into this set in such a way that it is different from every existing point in the set, and it becomes the closest point to every point in the set. Is it possible?

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Alice and Bob have $$$n$$$ items they'd like to split between them, so they decided to play a game. All items have a cost, and the $$$i$$$-th item costs $$$a_i$$$. Players move in turns starting from Alice.

In each turn, the player chooses one of the remaining items and takes it. The game goes on until no items are left.

Let's say that $$$A$$$ is the total cost of items taken by Alice and $$$B$$$ is the total cost of Bob's items. The resulting score of the game then will be equal to $$$A - B$$$.

Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it. Both Alice and Bob will play optimally.

But the game will take place tomorrow, so today Bob can modify the costs a little. He can increase the costs $$$a_i$$$ of several (possibly none or all) items by an integer value (possibly, by the same value or by different values for each item). However, the total increase must be less than or equal to $$$k$$$. Otherwise, Alice may suspect something. Note that Bob can't decrease costs, only increase.

What is the minimum possible score Bob can achieve?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \le k \le 10^9$$$) — the number of items and the maximum total increase Bob can make.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the initial costs of the items.

It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible score $$$A - B$$$ after Bob increases the costs of several (possibly none or all) items.

Portals are used to move between cities. There are $$$4$$$ colors of portals: blue, green, red, and yellow. Each city has portals of two different colors. You can move from city $$$i$$$ to city $$$j$$$ if they have portals of the same color (for example, you can move between a "blue-red" city and a "blue-green" city). This movement costs $$$|i-j|$$$ coins.

Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries: calculate the minimum cost to move from city $$$x$$$ to city $$$y$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of cities and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ strings of the following types: BG, BR, BY, GR, GY, or RY; the $$$i$$$-th of them describes the portals located in the $$$i$$$-th city; the symbol B indicates that there is a blue portal in the city, G — green, R — red, and Y — yellow.

The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_j$$$ and $$$y_j$$$ ($$$1 \le x_j, y_j \le n$$$) — the description of the $$$j$$$-th query.

Additional constraints on the input:

- the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$;

Given an integer $$$n$$$, construct a permutation $$$p$$$ of integers $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$ that maximizes the value of $$$k$$$ (which is initially $$$0$$$) after the following process.

Perform $$$n$$$ operations, on the $$$i$$$-th operation ($$$i=1, 2, \dots, n$$$),

- If $$$i$$$ is odd, $$$k=k\,\&\,p_i$$$, where $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.
- If $$$i$$$ is even, $$$k=k\,|\,p_i$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$5\le n\le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the maximum value of $$$k$$$ in the first line and output the permutation $$$p_1, p_2,\ldots, p_n$$$ in the second line.

- Choose two distinct indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ where $$$\bf{1\le i < j\le m}$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ is even, divide $$$b_i$$$ by $$$2$$$ and multiply $$$b_j$$$ by $$$2$$$.

You want to make the values of all nodes equal to $$$0$$$. To do so, you will perform a series of operations on the tree, where each operation will be performed on a certain node. Define an operation on node $$$u$$$ as choosing a single node in $$$u$$$'s subtree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ and incrementing or decrementing its value by $$$1$$$. The order in which operations are performed on nodes is as follows:

- For $$$1 \le i \le n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th operation will be performed on node $$$i$$$.
- For $$$i > n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th operation will be performed on the same node as operation $$$i - n$$$.

More formally, the $$$i$$$-th operation will be performed on the $$$(((i - 1) \bmod n) + 1)$$$-th node.$$$^{\text{†}}$$$

Note that you cannot skip over operations; that is, you cannot perform the $$$i$$$-th operation without first performing operations $$$1, 2, \ldots, i - 1$$$.

Find the minimum number of operations you must perform before you can make the values of all nodes equal to $$$0$$$, assuming you pick operations optimally. If it's impossible to make the values of all nodes equal to $$$0$$$ after finite operations, output $$$-1$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2000$$$, $$$1 \le x \le n$$$) — the number of nodes and the root of the tree.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the starting value of each node.

Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines of each test case contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$u \neq v$$$) representing an undirected edge from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer denoting the minimum amount of operations needed to make all nodes $$$0$$$. If it's impossible to make all nodes $$$0$$$, output $$$-1$$$.

Well, well, well, let's see how Bessie is managing her finances. She seems to be in the trenches! Fortunately, she is applying for a job at Moogle to resolve this issue. Moogle interviews require intensive knowledge of obscure algorithms and complex data structures, but Bessie received a tip-off from an LGM on exactly what she has to go learn.

Bessie wrote the following code to binary search for a certain element $$$k$$$ in a possibly unsorted array $$$[a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n]$$$ with $$$n$$$ elements.

Bessie submitted her code to Farmer John's problem with $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq n$$$) tests. The $$$i$$$-th test is of the form $$$(x_i, k_i)$$$ ($$$1 \leq x, k \leq n$$$). It is guaranteed all the $$$x_i$$$ are distinct and all the $$$k_i$$$ are distinct.

Test $$$i$$$ is correct if the following hold:

1. The $$$x_i$$$-th element in the array is $$$k_i$$$.
2. If Bessie calls the binary search as shown in the above code for $$$k_i$$$, it will return $$$x_i$$$.

It might not be possible for all $$$m$$$ tests to be correct on the same array, so Farmer John will remove some of them so Bessie can AC. Let $$$r$$$ be the minimum of tests removed so that there exists an array $$$[a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n]$$$ with $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$ so that all remaining tests are correct.

In addition to finding $$$r$$$, Farmer John wants you to count the number of arrays $$$[a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n]$$$ with $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$ such that there exists a way to remove exactly $$$r$$$ tests so that all the remaining tests are correct. Since this number may be very large, please find it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq n \leq 3000$$$) denoting the number of the array and the number of tests.

The following $$$m$$$ lines each contain two integers, describing the tests. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_i, k_i \leq n$$$) denoting the index and value of the test. It is guaranteed all $$$x_i$$$ are distinct and all $$$k_i$$$ are distinct.

It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

For each test case, output two integers, $$$r$$$ — the minimum of tests removed so that there exists an array so that all remaining tests are correct, and the number of arrays such that it is possible to remove $$$r$$$ tests to make all remaining tests correct modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Bessie submitted her code to Farmer John's problem with $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq n$$$) tests. The $$$i$$$-th test is of the form $$$(x_i, k_i)$$$ ($$$1 \leq x, k \leq n$$$). It is guaranteed all the $$$x_i$$$ are distinct and all the $$$k_i$$$ are distinct.

Test $$$i$$$ is correct if the following hold:

1. The $$$x_i$$$-th element in the array is $$$k_i$$$.
2. If Bessie calls the binary search as shown in the above code for $$$k_i$$$, it will return $$$x_i$$$.

It might not be possible for all $$$m$$$ tests to be correct on the same array, so Farmer John will remove some of them so Bessie can AC. Let $$$r$$$ be the minimum of tests removed so that there exists an array $$$[a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n]$$$ with $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$ so that all remaining tests are correct.

In addition to finding $$$r$$$, Farmer John wants you to count the number of arrays $$$[a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n]$$$ with $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$ such that there exists a way to remove exactly $$$r$$$ tests so that all the remaining tests are correct. Since this number may be very large, please find it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) denoting the number of the array and the number of tests.

The following $$$m$$$ lines each contain two integers, describing the tests. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_i, k_i \leq n$$$) denoting the index and value of the test. It is guaranteed all $$$x_i$$$ are distinct and all $$$k_i$$$ are distinct.

It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output two integers, $$$r$$$ — the minimum of tests removed so that there exists an array so that all remaining tests are correct, and the number of arrays such that it is possible to remove $$$r$$$ tests to make all remaining tests correct modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given two permutations$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$.

You can perform the following three-step operation on permutation $$$a$$$:

1. Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$).
2. Cyclic shift $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}$$$ by $$$1$$$ to the right. If you had chosen $$$i = 1$$$, then this range doesn't exist, and you cyclic shift nothing.
3. Cyclic shift $$$a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2}, \ldots, a_n$$$ by $$$1$$$ to the right. If you had chosen $$$i = n$$$, then this range doesn't exist, and you cyclic shift nothing.

After the operation, $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_{i-2},a_{i-1},a_i,a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2},\ldots,a_{n-1}, a_n$$$ is transformed into $$$a_{i-1},a_1,\ldots,a_{i-3},a_{i-2},a_i,a_n, a_{i + 1},\ldots,a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}$$$.

Here are some examples of operations done on the identity permutation $$$[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]$$$ of length $$$7$$$:

- If we choose $$$i = 3$$$, it will become $$$[2, 1, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]$$$.
- If we choose $$$i = 1$$$, it will become $$$[1, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$$$.
- If we choose $$$i = 7$$$, it will become $$$[6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]$$$.

Find a construction using at most $$$2n$$$ operations to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ or print $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible. The number of operations does not need to be minimized. It can be shown that if it is possible to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$, it is possible to do this within $$$2n$$$ operations.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the lengths of permutations $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the values of permutation $$$a$$$.

The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le n$$$) — the values of permutation $$$b$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case:

If there is a sequence of operations to transform $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$, output a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$0\le q\le 2n$$$) — the number of operations in the first line and $$$q$$$ integers with the $$$i$$$-th number representing the index of the $$$i$$$-th operation in the second line.

If there is no sequence of operations, output $$$-1$$$ in the only line.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: There is an apartment consisting of $$$n$$$ rooms, each with its light initially turned off.

To control the lights in these rooms, the owner of the apartment decided to install chips in the rooms so that each room has exactly one chip, and the chips are installed at different times. Specifically, these times are represented by the array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the time (in minutes) at which a chip is installed in the $$$i$$$-th room.

As soon as a chip is installed, it changes the room's light status every $$$k$$$ minutes — it turns on the light for $$$k$$$ minutes, then turns it off for the next $$$k$$$ minutes, then turns it back on for the next $$$k$$$ minutes, and so on. In other words, the light status is changed by the chip at minute $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_i + k$$$, $$$a_i + 2k$$$, $$$a_i + 3k$$$, $$$\ldots$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th room.

What is the earliest moment when all rooms in the apartment have their lights turned on?

Input and Output Format:

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

In one operation, you can select any subarray of size $$$k$$$ of $$$a$$$, then remove it from the array without changing the order of other elements. More formally, let $$$(l, r)$$$ be an operation on subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$ such that $$$r-l+1=k$$$, then performing this operation means replacing $$$a$$$ with $$$[a_1, \ldots, a_{l-1}, a_{r+1}, \ldots, a_n]$$$.

For example, if $$$a=[1,2,3,4,5]$$$ and we perform operation $$$(3,5)$$$ on this array, it will become $$$a=[1,2]$$$. Moreover, operation $$$(2, 4)$$$ results in $$$a=[1,5]$$$, and operation $$$(1,3)$$$ results in $$$a=[4,5]$$$.

$$$^\dagger$$$The median of an array of length $$$n$$$ is the element whose index is $$$\left \lfloor (n+1)/2 \right \rfloor$$$ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: $$$median([2,1,5,4,3]) = 3$$$, $$$median([5]) = 5$$$, and $$$median([6,8,2,4]) = 4$$$.

The integer lying at the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column of the matrix is called $$$a_{i,j}$$$.

Let's define $$$f(i)$$$ and $$$g(j)$$$ as the XOR of all integers in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column, respectively. In one operation, you can either:

- Select any row $$$i$$$, then assign $$$a_{i,j} := g(j)$$$ for each $$$1 \le j \le m$$$; or
- Select any column $$$j$$$, then assign $$$a_{i,j} := f(i)$$$ for each $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.

An example of applying an operation on column $$$2$$$ of the matrix.

In this example, as we apply an operation on column $$$2$$$, all elements in this column are changed:

- $$$a_{1,2} := f(1) = a_{1,1} \oplus a_{1,2} \oplus a_{1,3} \oplus a_{1,4} = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 0$$$
- $$$a_{2,2} := f(2) = a_{2,1} \oplus a_{2,2} \oplus a_{2,3} \oplus a_{2,4} = 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 5 \oplus 7 = 3$$$
- $$$a_{3,2} := f(3) = a_{3,1} \oplus a_{3,2} \oplus a_{3,3} \oplus a_{3,4} = 2 \oplus 0 \oplus 3 \oplus 0 = 1$$$
- $$$a_{4,2} := f(4) = a_{4,1} \oplus a_{4,2} \oplus a_{4,3} \oplus a_{4,4} = 10 \oplus 11 \oplus 12 \oplus 16 = 29$$$

You can apply the operations any number of times. Then, we calculate the $$$\textit{beauty}$$$ of the final matrix by summing the absolute differences between all pairs of its adjacent cells.

More formally, $$$\textit{beauty}(a) = \sum|a_{x,y} - a_{r,c}|$$$ for all cells $$$(x, y)$$$ and $$$(r, c)$$$ if they are adjacent. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.

Find the minimum $$$\textit{beauty}$$$ among all obtainable matrices.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$(n^2 + m^2)$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer $$$b$$$ — the smallest possible $$$\textit{beauty}$$$ of the matrix.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$k \le n$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Given a $$$w \times h$$$ rectangle on the $$$Oxy$$$ plane, with points $$$(0, 0)$$$ at the bottom-left and $$$(w, h)$$$ at the top-right of the rectangle.

You also have a robot initially at point $$$(0, 0)$$$ and a script $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters. Each character is either L, R, U, or D, which tells the robot to move left, right, up, or down respectively.

The robot can only move inside the rectangle; otherwise, it will change the script $$$s$$$ as follows:

- If it tries to move outside a vertical border, it changes all L characters to R's (and vice versa, all R's to L's).
- If it tries to move outside a horizontal border, it changes all U characters to D's (and vice versa, all D's to U's).

Then, it will execute the changed script starting from the character which it couldn't execute.

An example of the robot's movement process, $$$s = \texttt{"ULULURD"}$$$

The script $$$s$$$ will be executed for $$$k$$$ times continuously. All changes to the string $$$s$$$ will be retained even when it is repeated. During this process, how many times will the robot move to the point $$$(0, 0)$$$ in total? Note that the initial position does NOT count.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$w$$$, and $$$h$$$ ($$$1 \le n, w, h \le 10^6$$$; $$$1 \le k \le n$$$).

The second line contains a single string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$ ($$$s_i \in \{\texttt{L}, \texttt{R}, \texttt{U}, \texttt{D}\}$$$) — the script to be executed.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer — the number of times the robot reaches $$$(0, 0)$$$ when executing script $$$s$$$ for $$$k$$$ times continuously.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Bowling is a national sport in Taiwan; everyone in the country plays the sport on a daily basis since their youth. Naturally, there are a lot of bowling alleys all over the country, and the competition between them is as intense as you can imagine.

Maw-Shang owns one such bowling alley. To stand out from other competitors in the industry and draw attention from customers, he decided to hold a special event every month that features various unorthodox bowling rules. For the event this month, he came up with a new version of the game called X-pin bowling. In the traditional $$$10$$$-pin bowling game, a frame is built out of ten bowling pins forming a triangular shape of side length four. The pin closest to the player forms the first row, and the two pins behind it form the second row, and so on. Unlike the standard version, the game of $$$X$$$-pin bowling Maw-Shang designed allows a much larger number of pins that form a larger frame. The following figure shows a standard $$$10$$$-pin frame on the left, and on the right it shows a $$$21$$$-pin frame that forms a triangular shape of side length six which is allowed in the game of $$$X$$$-pin bowling.

Being the national sport, the government of Taiwan strictly regulates and standardizes the manufacturing of bowling pins. There are two types of bowling pins allowed, one in black and the other in white, and the bowling alley Maw-Shang owns has $$$w$$$ white pins and $$$b$$$ black pins. To make this new game exciting for the customers, Maw-Shang wants to build the largest possible frame from these $$$w+b$$$ pins. However, even though he is okay with using both colors in building the frame, for aesthetic reasons, Maw-Shang still wants the colors of the pins on the same row to be identical. For example, the following figure shows two possible frames of side length six, but only the left one is acceptable to Maw-Shang since the other one has white and black pins mixed in the third row.

The monthly special event is happening in just a few hours. Please help Maw-Shang calculate the side length of the largest frame that he can build from his $$$w+b$$$ pins!

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$, the number of test cases. Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains two integers $$$w$$$ and $$$b$$$, the number of white and black pins, respectively.

- $$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$
- $$$0 \leq w, b \leq 10^9$$$

For each test case, output in a single line the side length $$$k$$$ of the largest pin satisfying Maw-Shang's requirement you can build with the given pins.

That is, if we identify the positions in the cube by three Cartesian coordinates, then choosing two numbers from positions $$$(x,y,z)$$$ and $$$(x',y',z')$$$ is forbidden if $$$x=x'$$$, $$$y=y'$$$, or $$$z=z'$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The input consists of the number $$$n$$$ followed by $$$n^3$$$ numbers in the cube. The numbers are presented as $$$n$$$ two-dimensional matrices, one for each layer of the cube. More precisely, there will be $$$n^2$$$ lines follow, each having $$$n$$$ numbers. For each $$$x, y, z$$$ ($$$1\le x, y, z\le n$$$), the number at the position $$$(x, y, z)$$$ is listed as the $$$z$$$-th number in the $$$((x-1)\times n+y)$$$-th line.

You are given a two-dimensional maze with a start and end position. Your task is to find the fastest way to get from the start to the end position. The fastest way is to make the minimum number of steps where one step is going left, right, up, or down. Of course, you cannot walk through walls.

There is, however, a catch: If you make more than three steps in the same direction, you lose balance and fall down. Therefore, it is forbidden to make more than three consecutive steps in the same direction. It is okay to walk three times to the right, then one step to the left, and then again three steps to the right. This has the same effect as taking five steps to the right, but is slower.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, which are the height and width of the maze. This is followed by an ASCII-representation of the maze where $$$\tt{\#}$$$ is a wall, $$$\tt{.}$$$ is an empty space, and $$$\tt S$$$ and $$$\tt T$$$ are the start and end positions.

- $$$12 \leq n\times m \leq 200000$$$.
- $$$3\leq n,m \leq 10000$$$.
- Characters are only $$$\tt{.\#ST}$$$ and there is exactly one $$$\tt{S}$$$ and one $$$\tt{T}$$$.
- The outer borders are only $$$\tt{\#}$$$ (walls).

A-Ming's birthday is coming and his friend A-May decided to give him an integer array as a present. A-Ming has two favorite numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and he thinks an array is beautiful if its mean is exactly $$$a$$$ and its median is exactly $$$b$$$. Please help A-May find a beautiful array so her gift can impress A-Ming.

The mean of an array is its sum divided by its length. For example, the mean of array $$$[3, -1, 5, 5]$$$ is $$$12 \div 4 = 3$$$.

The median of an array is its middle element after sorting if its length is odd, or the mean of two middle elements after sorting if its length is even. For example, the median of $$$[1, 1, 2, 4, 8]$$$ is $$$2$$$ and the median of $$$[3, -1, 5, 5]$$$ is $$$(3 + 5) \div 2 = 4$$$.

Note that the mean and median are not rounded to an integer. For example, the mean of array $$$[1, 2]$$$ is $$$1.5$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.

- $$$-100 \leq a, b \leq 100$$$.
- The length of the array must be between $$$1$$$ and $$$1000$$$.
- The elements of the array must be integers and their absolute values must not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

In the first line, print the length of the array.

In the second line, print the elements of the array.

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any. It can be proved that, under the constraints of the problem, a solution always exists.

2. Operation $$$\tt{RTL}$$$: he folds the segment from right to left, where $$$r$$$ coincides with a point $$$x$$$ ($$$\ell \le x < r$$$) such that $$$r+x$$$ is a prime number. When Peter chooses this operation, he always chooses the smallest possible value $$$x$$$. Note that the segment occupies the interval $$$[\ell, \frac{1}{2}(r+x)]$$$ afterwards.

A folding sequence refers to a sequence of operations specified above. Peter wants to fold the segment several times, resulting in the shortest possible interval whose length that cannot be further reduced. The length of an interval $$$[\ell, r]$$$ is defined naturally to be $$$r-\ell$$$. Let's consider the following example. Suppose that we are folding a segment initially occupying the interval $$$[1, 30]$$$. There are three folding sequences that lead to the shortest possible resulting interval, as shown in the following figure.

Please help Peter determine the number of folding sequences such that the resulting interval has a shortest possible length. Output the number modulo $$$998244353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$, denoting the number of test cases. In each of the following $$$t$$$ lines, there are two integers $$$\ell$$$ and $$$r$$$.

- $$$1 \le t \le 10$$$
- $$$1 \le \ell < r \le 10^{12}$$$
- $$$r - \ell \le 10^5$$$

For each test case, please output a line denoting the number of ways to fold the given segment such that the resulting segment has the shortest possible length, modulo $$$998244353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Claire loves drawing lines. She receives a sheet of paper with an $$$n \times n$$$ grid and begins drawing "lines" on it. Well—the concept of a "line" here is not what we usually think of. Claire refers each line to be a set of consecutive vertical grid cells. When she draws a line, these cells are all covered with black ink. Initially, all the cells are white, and drawing lines turns some of them black. After drawing a few lines, Claire wonders: how many ways she can color an additional white cell black so that the remaining white cells do not form a single connected component.

Two cells are directly connected if they share an edge. Two cells $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are indirectly connected if there exists a sequence of cells $$$c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_k$$$ with $$$k > 1$$$ such that $$$c_0 = x$$$, $$$c_k = y$$$, and for every $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$$$ the cells $$$c_i$$$ and $$$c_{i-1}$$$ are directly connected. A set of cells forms a single connected component if each pair of cells in the set is either directly or indirectly connected.

The grid has $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns, both indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Claire will draw $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line is drawn in the $$$y_i$$$-th column, from the $$$s_i$$$-th row to the $$$f_i$$$-th row, where $$$s_i \leq f_i$$$ for each $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, q\}$$$. Note that the cells that are passed by at least one of the $$$q$$$ lines are colored black. The following figure shows an example of a $$$20\times 20$$$ grid with $$$q=67$$$ lines. The grid cells marked with red star symbols refer to the cells such that, if Claire colors that cell black, all white cells no longer form a single connected component.

You may assume that, after drawing the $$$q$$$ lines, the remaining white cells form a single connected component with at least three white cells.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains exactly one integer $$$t$$$, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it begins with a line containing exactly two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$. This indicates that the grid is $$$n$$$ by $$$n$$$ and that Claire draws $$$q$$$ lines on it. Then $$$q$$$ lines follow. For each $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, q\}$$$, the $$$i$$$-th line among the $$$q$$$ lines contains exactly three integers $$$y_i$$$, $$$s_i$$$, and $$$f_i$$$.

- $$$1\le t \le 125$$$
- $$$2\leq n \leq 10^9$$$
- $$$q\ge 1$$$; the sum of all $$$q$$$ values is at most $$$10^5$$$.
- $$$1\leq y_i \leq n$$$
- $$$1\leq s_i \leq f_i \leq n$$$
- There are at least three white cells and all white cells form a connected component.

Print an integer on a line, indicating how many ways Claire can color an additional white cell black so that the remaining white cells do not form a single connected component.

Alice likes singing. As a singing enthusiast, Alice has listened to countless songs and has tried singing them many times. However, occasionally, some songs make Alice feel bored. After some research, Alice believes that this is because even though the songs she chose are all different, due to her instinctive preference, they all turn out to be musically similar to one another.

To thoroughly analyze this, Alice decided to study the sheet music of the songs. For convenience, Alice represented a song of length $$$n$$$ as an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the pitch of the $$$i$$$-th note. Then she defined the musical equivalence between songs. Two songs $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ are musically equivalent if for all $$$1\leq i<n$$$, both $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ and $$$b_{i}, b_{i+1}$$$ have the same pitch relationship. More specifically, $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ and $$$b_i, b_{i+1}$$$ have the same pitch relationship if either

- $$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i < b_{i + 1}$$$,
- $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i = b_{i + 1}$$$, or
- $$$a_i > a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i > b_{i + 1}$$$.

Having practiced consistently for a long time, Alice is able to sing any note in the range of $$$[1, k]$$$. She wants to know how many different songs of length $$$n$$$ within her range there are, if we treat musically equivalent songs as the same one. Can you help her calculate the number?

Since the answer might be large, print the answer modulo $$$998244353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The only line contains two integers $$$n, k$$$.

- $$$1\leq n\leq 10^6$$$
- $$$1\leq k \leq 10^9$$$

Output the number of different songs modulo $$$998244353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are designing a snazzy new text editor, and you want to add a nifty auto-complete feature to help users save time. Here is how it will work: if a user types "App", your editor will magically suggest the word "Application"! Even better, users can personalize the words that auto-complete in your editor.

Your editor will support 4 kinds of operations (Let's say the current text in your editor is $$$t$$$):

1. Add an auto complete pattern $$$p_i$$$.
2. Delete an auto complete pattern $$$p_i$$$.
3. Append a string $$$s$$$ to the end of $$$t$$$.
4. Delete $$$c$$$ characters from the end of $$$t$$$. Note that if $$$c$$$ is larger then the length of $$$t$$$, delete all the characters from $$$t$$$.

After each action, your editor should suggest an auto-complete candidate $$$i$$$ that matches the following criteria:

1. The string $$$p_i$$$ has a prefix equal to $$$t$$$.
2. If there are multiple $$$p_i$$$, pick the longest one.
3. If there are still multiple $$$p_i$$$, pick the one with the smallest lexicographic order.
4. If there are still multiple $$$p_i$$$, pick the one with the smallest ID.

For example, let us say we have three candidates: "alice", "bob", and "charlie", with ID 1, 2, and 3. At first, there is nothing on the screen, so "charlie" (3) should be suggested because it is the longest. Then, let us say the user types "b". You should suggest "bob" (2) because it is the only one that starts with "b". Finally, let us say the user type "body". You should print -1 because there is no matched pattern.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$, followed by $$$n$$$ lines, with each line containing an action.

There are four types of actions:

1. $$$i$$$ $$$p_i$$$
2. $$$i$$$
3. $$$s$$$
4. $$$c$$$

- $$$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$
- The total number of characters in all $$$p_i$$$ and $$$s$$$ does not exceed $$$2\times 10^6$$$.
- $$$1 \leq c \leq 2\times 10^6$$$
- The strings $$$p_i$$$ and $$$s$$$ may contain any printable characters, excluding all space characters (ASCII number in the range from $$$33$$$ to $$$126$$$).
- The ID $$$i$$$ for each add operation is unique.
- The ID $$$i$$$ for each delete is guaranteed to be valid.
- Each ID $$$i$$$ satisfies $$$0\le i \le n$$$.

The program should output $$$n$$$ lines. For each action, output an integer $$$i$$$, which means that after the action, $$$p_i$$$ is the suggested auto complete candidate. If there is no $$$p_i$$$ that matches the requirement, output -1.

Mayaw works in a renowned Epah (aboriginal Taiwanese millet wine; Epah is the Pangcah term for aboriginal Taiwanese millet wine, named in the language of the Pangcah people, the largest Indigenous group in Taiwan) bar in the Fata'an Village. To showcase the depth of its collections, the bar has a two-row wine rack where each row can fit exactly $$$n$$$ bottles. There are already $$$n$$$ bottles placed on the back row of the rack, where the $$$i$$$-th bottle from left has height $$$a_i$$$. The owner of the bar has another $$$n$$$ bottles with distinct heights $$$b_1, \ldots, b_n$$$ that he would like Mayaw to put on the first row. To ensure that all bottles on the rack are visible, the owner requires that each bottle on the back row should not be blocked by the one put in front of it. That is, if a bottle of height $$$h$$$ is put on the $$$i$$$-th spot (from left) in the first row, then $$$h$$$ must be less than $$$a_i$$$. However, not all such arrangements are good for the owner. To pay tributes to the Maxi Mountain nearby, he additionally demands that the bottles in the front row should display a mountain-like shape. In particular, the heights of the bottles, when listing from left to right, should form a sequence that is first (non-strictly) increasing and then (non-strictly) decreasing.

Unfortunately, sometimes it is impossible to achieve owner's requirements. That is why Mayaw is also allowed to slightly reduce a bottle's height by removing its cap that has a height of $$$1$$$. In other words, after the removal of the cap, the height of the bottle decreases by exactly $$$1$$$. Of course, exposing the Epah inside the bottle to the open air is detrimental to its quality, and therefore it is desirable to remove as few bottle caps as possible.

Can you help Mayaw determine the minimum number of caps needed to be removed so that he can arrange the bottles in a way that satisfies the owner's requirements? Note that the positions of the bottles in the back row are fixed and Mayaw is not allowed to modify them.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ which represents the number of bottles in each row. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$, the height of the bottles in the back row. The third line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$b_1, \ldots, b_n$$$, the height of the bottles in the front row.

- $$$1 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^5$$$
- $$$1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9$$$
- All $$$b_i$$$'s are distinct.

Output the minimum number of bottle caps needed to be removed so that Mayaw can arrange the bottles in the desired way. If it is impossible to achieve that (regardless of the number of caps removed), output -1 instead.

In an interdisciplinary collaboration, an ecosystem scientist and a computer scientist join forces to analyze the structure of a complex ecosystem using computational methods. The ecosystem scientist models the ecosystem as a directed graph $$$D = (V, A)$$$, where each species is represented by a node $$$v \in V$$$, and each feeding relationship is represented as a directed edge $$$(x, y) \in A$$$ from prey $$$x$$$ to predator $$$y$$$. This graph structure allows them to simulate the flow of energy throughout the ecosystem from one species to another.

Two essential features of the ecosystem are defined:

- Independent Trophic Group: A set $$$S$$$ of animal species is classified as an independent trophic group if no species $$$x \in S$$$ can reach another species $$$y \in S$$$ (for some $$$y \ne x$$$) through a series of directed feeding relationships, meaning there is no directed path in $$$D$$$ from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$.
- Trophic Balance Species: A species is termed a trophic balance species if it has a nearly equal number of species that affect it as directly or indirectly predators (species it can reach via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself) and species that affect it as directly or indirectly prey (species that can reach it via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself). Specifically, trophic balance species are those for which the absolute difference between the above two numbers is minimum among all species in the ecosystem.

Consider an ecosystem with $$$n = 4$$$ species and $$$m = 3$$$ feeding relationships:

- Species 1: Grass (Node 1)
- Species 2: Rabbits (Node 2)
- Species 3: Foxes (Node 3)
- Species 4: Hawks (Node 4)

The directed edges representing the feeding relationships are as follows:

- $$$(1, 2)$$$: Grass is eaten by Rabbits.
- $$$(2, 3)$$$: Rabbits are eaten by Foxes.
- $$$(2, 4)$$$: Rabbits are also eaten by Hawks.

Now, consider the set $$$S=\{3,4\}$$$ (Foxes and Hawks). There are no directed paths between Foxes (Node 3) and Hawks (Node 4); Foxes cannot reach Hawks, and Hawks cannot reach Foxes through any directed paths. Therefore, this set qualifies as an independent trophic group.

Examination of Species

- Species 1 (Grass):    Can reach: 3 (Rabbits, Foxes, and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 0 (None)    Absolute difference: $$$|3 - 0| = 3$$$
- Species 2 (Rabbits):   Can reach: 2 (Foxes and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 1 (Grass)    Absolute difference: $$$|2 - 1| = 1$$$
- Species 3 (Foxes):   Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: $$$|0-2| = 2$$$
- Species 4 (Hawks):   Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: $$$|0-2| = 2$$$

Among these species, Rabbits have the smallest absolute difference of $$$1$$$, indicating that they are a trophic balance species within the ecosystem.

It is known that any independent trophic group in the ecosystem has a size of at most $$$k$$$. The task is to find the set of all trophic balance species in the ecosystem.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains exactly two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, where $$$n$$$ (resp. $$$m$$$) denotes the number of nodes (resp. edges) in the directed graph $$$D$$$ induced by the investigated ecosystem. The nodes are numbered as $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$. Then, $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ indicating a directed edge from node $$$x_i$$$ to node $$$y_i$$$.

- $$$1 \le n \le 2 \times 10^5$$$
- $$$0 \le m \le \min\{ n(n-1), 4 \times 10^5\}$$$
- $$$k$$$ is not an input value, and it is guaranteed that $$$1 \le k \le 16$$$ for each investigated ecosystem.
- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le m$$$), $$$1\le x_i, y_i\le n$$$ and $$$x_i\neq y_i$$$.
- Each ordered pair $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ appears at most once in the input.

Output on a single line the node identidiers of all trophic balance species in ascending order. For any two consecutive node identifiers, separate them by a space.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: A-Ju has a gorgeous castle in which she often enjoys living. However, she gets tired of living in the castle for a long time. Thus, she decides to rebuild her castle into some specific shape to make her it more beautiful.

Let's say we represent A-Ju's castle as a 2D convex polygon$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ on the 2D plane. A-Ju aims to rebuild her castle into a point symmetric convex polygon. Here, a polygon is point symmetric if there exists a center $$$c$$$ such that for every point $$$p$$$ in the polygon, the reflection $$$p^\prime$$$ of $$$p$$$ across $$$c$$$ is also in the polygon.

While designing an arbitrary point symmetric convex polygon shape is easy, the cost of rebuilding is very high. After some estimation, A-Ju found that the cost of rebuilding is proportional to the area of the symmetric difference$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ between the original castle and the new castle. See the following figure for an example:

In the example above, A-Ju's castle is a shape of the convex polygon formed by points $$$(3, 7) - (2, 1) - (6, 3)$$$. After rebuilding her castle into the shape of the polygon formed by $$$(3, 7) - (\frac{7}{3}, 3) - (\frac{13}{3}, \frac{1}{3}) - (5, \frac{13}{3})$$$, the area of the symmetric difference between these two polygons will be $$$\frac{11}{3}$$$. The difference can be calculated as the sum of the additional area (represented by the green grid region) and the shaved area (represented by the red line region).

Please write a program that helps A-Ju design a blueprint of the new castle, such that the area of the symmetric difference between the original one and the new one is minimized. You only need to output the minimum value since A-Ju wants to estimate her cost first.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$, representing the number of vertices of the polygon that forms A-Ju's castle.

Then, $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains two integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$, representing the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th vertex. The vertices are given in a counterclockwise order.

- $$$3\leq n\leq 500$$$
- $$$|x_i|, |y_i|\leq 10^4$$$
- The vertices are given in a counterclockwise order and are guaranteed to form a convex polygon without three collinear points.

Print a single real number in one line, representing the minimum area of the symmetric difference between the original castle and the new castle.

Your answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-4}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is considered correct if $$$\frac{|a-b|}{\max(1,|b|)}\le 10^{-4}$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Every student enrolled in the algorithms course is required to submit an assignment this week. The task is to implement an $$$O(n^2)$$$-time algorithm to sort $$$n$$$ given integers in non-decreasing order. Alice has already completed her assignment, and her implementation is shown below.

While you have access to Alice's code, you prefer not to simply copy it. Instead, you want to use Alice's sorting function as a building block for your own solution. There are two ways as listed below you can utilize her function, but each of them can be applied at most once. The order in which these two operations are invoked can be arbitrary.

- Prefix sort: choose a length $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$$$ and call $$$\texttt{alicesort(}s, i\texttt{)}$$$. This sorts the first $$$i$$$ elements in the array $$$s$$$.
- Suffix sort: choose a length $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$$$ and call $$$\texttt{alicesort(}s+n-i, i\texttt{)}$$$. This sorts the last $$$i$$$ elements in the array $$$s$$$.

Due to the time complexity of the sorting algorithm, the cost of performing either a prefix or suffix sort is $$$i^2$$$, where $$$i$$$ is the length of the chosen subarray. Your goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort the input array $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers in non-decreasing order using Alice's function, following the rules mentioned above.

For example, Let $$$s=[3,2,5,5,4,1]$$$. We can first perform a suffix sort of length $$$4$$$, and the array becomes $$$[3,2,1,4,5,5]$$$. Then, we perform a prefix sort of length $$$3$$$, and the array becomes $$$[1,2,3,4,5,5]$$$, which is a sorted array. The cost is $$$4^2+3^2=25$$$. Here is another example, let $$$s=[4,3,2,1]$$$. We can complete the sorting by performing only a prefix sort of length $$$4$$$, and the cost is $$$4^2=16$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains exactly one integer $$$n$$$ which indicates the number of integers in the array $$$s$$$. The second line contains the $$$n$$$ integers in $$$s=[s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_{n-1}]$$$.

- $$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$
- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$0\le i < n$$$), $$$0\le s_i < 2^{31}-1$$$.

Output an integer on a line, indicating the minimum cost to sort the input array $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers in non-decreasing order using Alice's function, following the rules mentioned above.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: The country of Truckski is located in a rugged, mountainous region, and the geological condition has engendered a wide range of issues. The challenging terrain separates the different states in the country, resulting in an extremely inconvenient inter-state commute and more crucially a lack of central governmental control. Adding on top of that is a rampant crime rate that increases annually, and this severely disrupts the everyday lives of innocent citizens.

A recent protest finally shed light on the situation, as the newly elected president has announced an ambitious project to resolve these issues. Her plan consists of two major components. The first is the construction of high-speed railways between the states to facilitate better connections and unity across the country. Since the states are mostly running independently from each other, to construct a railway between states $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, the government has to pay a fee of $$$a_u + a_v$$$ dollars, with $$$a_u$$$ dollars given to state $$$u$$$ and $$$a_v$$$ dollars given to state $$$v$$$. The railway operates bidirectionally, meaning that once it is built, people from state $$$u$$$ can now travel to state $$$v$$$ and vice versa. A railway can be built between almost any pair of states, except for $$$m$$$ particular pairs for which the terrain dividing them is so treacherous that the construction of a direct railroad between the two states becomes impossible.

The second component of the project is to build a centralized prison that manages all criminals across the country. Given the large number of estimated prisoners, the president decided to pick one of the states to build the central prison and sever the connection from the state to the rest of the country.

An illustration for the sample input 1. (a) The costs of building direct railways between the states. (b) Consider building the central prison in State #3. All direct railroads that do not involve State #3 have to be built, with a total cost of $$$3+3+2=8$$$ dollars.

Given the above, the president would like to search for the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between the states so that:

- the state with the central prison should not have any railway connecting it to any other states, and
- all the other states should be connected, i.e., people should be able to travel from one such state to another, possibly by taking more than one train.

You are working for the team in charge of the overall planning of the construction. The meeting with the president is happening in just a few hours, at which time you will have to brief her on the cost of different construction plans. Please calculate, for each state $$$u$$$, the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between states meeting the above conditions when $$$u$$$ is where the central prison is built.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, the number of states in Truckski and the number of pairs for which railroad construction is not feasible. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$, the construction fee the government needs to pay to the $$$i$$$-th state. Then, $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ meaning that it is impossible to build a (direct) railway between states $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.

- $$$2\leq n\leq 10^5$$$
- $$$0\leq m\leq 10^5$$$
- $$$1\leq a_i\leq 10^9$$$
- $$$1\leq u_i<v_i\leq n$$$
- For all $$$i\neq j, (u_i, v_i)\neq (u_j, v_j)$$$.

Output $$$n$$$ integers in one line. The $$$i$$$-th integer is the minimum construction cost when the $$$i$$$-th state is where the prison is built. If it is impossible to find a feasible railroad construction, output -1 instead.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given $$$n$$$ arrays $$$a_1$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$. The length of each array is two. Thus, $$$a_i = [a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}]$$$. You need to concatenate the arrays into a single array of length $$$2n$$$ such that the number of inversions$$$^{\dagger}$$$ in the resulting array is minimized. Note that you do not need to count the actual number of inversions.

More formally, you need to choose a permutation$$$^{\ddagger}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, so that the array $$$b = [a_{p_1,1}, a_{p_1,2}, a_{p_2, 1}, a_{p_2, 2}, \ldots, a_{p_n,1}, a_{p_n,2}]$$$ contains as few inversions as possible.

$$$^{\dagger}$$$The number of inversions in an array $$$c$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$c_i > c_j$$$.

$$$^{\ddagger}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of arrays.

Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_{i,1}$$$ and $$$a_{i,2}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{i,j} \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the $$$i$$$-th array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$2n$$$ integers — the elements of the array you obtained. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: It is already the year $$$3024$$$, ideas for problems have long run out, and the olympiad now takes place in a modified individual format. The olympiad consists of $$$n$$$ problems, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th problem has its own score $$$a_i$$$ and a certain parameter $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le n$$$).

Initially, the testing system gives the participant the first problem. When the participant is given the $$$i$$$-th problem, they have two options:

- They can submit the problem and receive $$$a_i$$$ points;
- They can skip the problem, in which case they will never be able to submit it.

Then, the testing system selects the next problem for the participant from problems with indices $$$j$$$, such that:

- If he submitted the $$$i$$$-th problem, it looks at problems with indices $$$j < i$$$;
- If he skipped the $$$i$$$-th problem, it looks at problems with indices $$$j \leq b_i$$$.

Among these problems, it selects the problem with the maximum index that it has not previously given to the participant (he has neither submitted nor skipped it before). If there is no such problem, then the competition for the participant ends, and their result is equal to the sum of points for all submitted problems. In particular, if the participant submits the first problem, then the competition for them ends. Note that the participant receives each problem at most once.

Prokhor has prepared thoroughly for the olympiad, and now he can submit any problem. Help him determine the maximum number of points he can achieve.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of problems in the olympiad.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the scores of the problems.

The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i \leq n$$$) — the parameters of the problems.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \cdot 10^5$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given two strongly connected$$$^{\dagger}$$$ directed graphs, each with exactly $$$n$$$ vertices, but possibly different numbers of edges. Upon closer inspection, you noticed an important feature — the length of any cycle in these graphs is divisible by $$$k$$$.

Each of the $$$2n$$$ vertices belongs to exactly one of two types: incoming or outgoing. For each vertex, its type is known to you.

You need to determine whether it is possible to draw exactly $$$n$$$ directed edges between the source graphs such that the following four conditions are met:

- The ends of any added edge lie in different graphs.
- From each outgoing vertex, exactly one added edge originates.
- Into each incoming vertex, exactly one added edge enters.
- In the resulting graph, the length of any cycle is divisible by $$$k$$$.

$$$^{\dagger}$$$A strongly connected graph is a graph in which there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in each graph and the value by which the length of each cycle is divisible.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i \in \{0, 1\}$$$). If $$$a_i = 0$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ of the first graph is incoming. If $$$a_i = 1$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ of the first graph is outgoing.

The third line of each test case contains a single integer $$$m_1$$$ ($$$1 \le m_1 \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of edges in the first graph.

The next $$$m_1$$$ lines contain descriptions of the edges of the first graph. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$$$) — an edge in the first graph leading from vertex $$$v_i$$$ to vertex $$$u_i$$$.

Next, in the same format, follows the description of the second graph.

The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$b_i \in \{0, 1\}$$$). If $$$b_i = 0$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ of the second graph is incoming. If $$$b_i = 1$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ of the second graph is outgoing.

The next line contains a single integer $$$m_2$$$ ($$$1 \le m_2 \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of edges in the second graph.

The next $$$m_2$$$ lines contain descriptions of the edges of the second graph. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$$$) — an edge in the second graph leading from vertex $$$v_i$$$ to vertex $$$u_i$$$.

It is guaranteed that both graphs are strongly connected, and the lengths of all cycles are divisible by $$$k$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m_1$$$ and the sum of $$$m_2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to draw $$$n$$$ new edges such that all conditions are met, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

The conditions in this casino are as follows:

- There are a total of $$$n$$$ games in the casino.
- You can play each game at most once.
- Each game is characterized by two parameters: $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le 100$$$) and $$$w_i$$$ — the probability of winning the game in percentage and the winnings for a win.
- If you lose in any game you decide to play, you will receive nothing at all (even for the games you won).

You need to choose a set of games in advance that you will play in such a way as to maximize the expected value of your winnings.

In this case, if you choose to play the games with indices $$$i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k$$$, you will win in all of them with a probability of $$$\prod\limits_{j=1}^k \frac{p_{i_j}}{100}$$$, and in that case, your winnings will be equal to $$$\sum\limits_{j=1}^k w_{i_j}$$$.

That is, the expected value of your winnings will be $$$\left(\prod\limits_{j=1}^k \frac{p_{i_j}}{100}\right) \cdot \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^k w_{i_j}\right)$$$.

To avoid going bankrupt, the casino owners have limited the expected value of winnings for each individual game. Thus, for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$), it holds that $$$w_i \cdot p_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Your task is to find the maximum expected value of winnings that can be obtained by choosing some set of games in the casino.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of games offered to play.

The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$p_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq 100$$$, $$$1 \leq w_i, p_i \cdot w_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the probability of winning and the size of the winnings in the $$$i$$$-th game.

Output a single number — the maximum expected value of winnings in the casino that can be obtained by choosing some subset of games.

Your answer will be accepted if the relative or absolute error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$. Formally, if $$$a$$$ is your answer and $$$b$$$ is the jury's answer, it will be accepted if $$$\frac{|a-b|}{\max(b, 1)} \le 10^{-6}$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: In the heart of an ancient kingdom grows the legendary Tree of Life — the only one of its kind and the source of magical power for the entire world. The tree consists of $$$n$$$ nodes. Each node of this tree is a magical source, connected to other such sources through magical channels (edges). In total, there are $$$n-1$$$ channels in the tree, with the $$$i$$$-th channel connecting nodes $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$. Moreover, there exists a unique simple path through the channels between any two nodes in the tree.

However, the magical energy flowing through these channels must be balanced; otherwise, the power of the Tree of Life may disrupt the natural order and cause catastrophic consequences. The sages of the kingdom discovered that when two magical channels converge at a single node, a dangerous "magical resonance vibration" occurs between them. To protect the Tree of Life and maintain its balance, it is necessary to select several paths and perform special rituals along them. A path is a sequence of distinct nodes $$$v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$$$, where each pair of adjacent nodes $$$v_i$$$ and $$$v_{i+1}$$$ is connected by a channel. When the sages perform a ritual along such a path, the resonance vibration between the channels $$$(v_i, v_{i+1})$$$ and $$$(v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$$$ is blocked for each $$$1 \leq i \leq k - 2$$$.

The sages' task is to select the minimum number of paths and perform rituals along them to block all resonance vibrations. This means that for every pair of channels emanating from a single node, there must exist at least one selected path that contains both of these channels.

Help the sages find the minimum number of such paths so that the magical balance of the Tree of Life is preserved, and its power continues to nourish the entire world!

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 4 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the Tree of Life.

The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines of each test case contains two integers $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq v_i < u_i \leq n$$$) — the channel connecting nodes $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$.

It is guaranteed that there exists a unique simple path through the channels between any two nodes.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of paths that the sages need to select to prevent a catastrophe.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: In a desert city with a hilly landscape, the city hall decided to level the road surface by purchasing a dump truck. The road is divided into $$$n$$$ sections, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. The height of the surface in the $$$i$$$-th section is equal to $$$a_i$$$. If the height of the $$$i$$$-th section is greater than $$$0$$$, then the dump truck must take sand from the $$$i$$$-th section of the road, and if the height of the $$$i$$$-th section is less than $$$0$$$, the dump truck must fill the pit in the $$$i$$$-th section of the road with sand. It is guaranteed that the initial heights are not equal to $$$0$$$.

When the dump truck is in the $$$i$$$-th section of the road, it can either take away $$$x$$$ units of sand, in which case the height of the surface in the $$$i$$$-th section will decrease by $$$x$$$, or it can fill in $$$x$$$ units of sand (provided that it currently has at least $$$x$$$ units of sand in its bed), in which case the height of the surface in the $$$i$$$-th section of the road will increase by $$$x$$$.

The dump truck can start its journey from any section of the road. Moving to an adjacent section on the left or right takes $$$1$$$ minute, and the time for loading and unloading sand can be neglected. The dump truck has an infinite capacity and is initially empty.

You need to find the minimum time required for the dump truck to level the sand so that the height in each section becomes equal to $$$0$$$. Note that after all movements, the dump truck may still have sand left in its bed. You need to solve this problem independently for the segments numbered from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$. Sand outside the segment cannot be used.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of sections and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$, $$$a_i \neq 0$$$) — the initial height in each section.

The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$) — the boundaries of the segment of sections for which the minimum time needs to be determined.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each query, output the minimum time required to level the sand in the segment $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an even integer $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le n$$$). You need to split the array $$$a$$$ into exactly $$$k$$$ non-empty subarrays$$$^{\dagger}$$$ such that each element of the array $$$a$$$ belongs to exactly one subarray.

Next, all subarrays with even indices (second, fourth, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$k$$$-th) are concatenated into a single array $$$b$$$. After that, $$$0$$$ is added to the end of the array $$$b$$$.

The cost of the array $$$b$$$ is defined as the minimum index $$$i$$$ such that $$$b_i \neq i$$$. For example, the cost of the array $$$b = [1, 2, 4, 5, 0]$$$ is $$$3$$$, since $$$b_1 = 1$$$, $$$b_2 = 2$$$, and $$$b_3 \neq 3$$$. Determine the minimum cost of the array $$$b$$$ that can be obtained with an optimal partitioning of the array $$$a$$$ into subarrays.

$$$^{\dagger}$$$An array $$$x$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input and Output Format:

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k$$$ is even) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of subarrays.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Nikyr has started working as a queue manager at the company "Black Contour." He needs to choose the order of servicing customers. There are a total of $$$n$$$ queues, each initially containing $$$0$$$ people. In each of the next $$$n$$$ moments of time, there are two sequential events:

1. New customers arrive in all queues. More formally, at the $$$j$$$-th moment of time, the number of people in the $$$i$$$-th queue increases by a positive integer $$$a_{i,j}$$$.
2. Nikyr chooses exactly one of the $$$n$$$ queues to be served at that moment in time. The number of customers in this queue becomes $$$0$$$.

Let the number of people in the $$$i$$$-th queue after all events be $$$x_i$$$. Nikyr wants MEX$$$^{\dagger}$$$ of the collection $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$ to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum value he can achieve with an optimal order of servicing the queues.

$$$^{\dagger}$$$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$y$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$.

For example:

- $$$\operatorname{MEX}([2,2,1])= 0$$$, since $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array.
- $$$\operatorname{MEX}([3,1,0,1]) = 2$$$, since $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not.

In both graphs, there is a token located at some vertex. In the first graph, the token is initially at vertex $$$s_1$$$, and in the second graph, the token is initially at vertex $$$s_2$$$. The following operation is repeated an infinite number of times:

- Let the token currently be at vertex $$$v_1$$$ in the first graph and at vertex $$$v_2$$$ in the second graph.
- A vertex $$$u_1$$$, adjacent to $$$v_1$$$, is chosen in the first graph.
- A vertex $$$u_2$$$, adjacent to $$$v_2$$$, is chosen in the second graph.
- The tokens are moved to the chosen vertices: in the first graph, the token moves from $$$v_1$$$ to $$$u_1$$$, and in the second graph, from $$$v_2$$$ to $$$u_2$$$.
- The cost of such an operation is equal to $$$|u_1 - u_2|$$$.

Determine the minimum possible total cost of all operations or report that this value will be infinitely large.

The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m_1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$$$, $$$a_i \ne b_i$$$) — the numbers of the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th edge in the first graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$, the sum of $$$m_1$$$, and the sum of $$$m_2$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$1000$$$.

Island $$$i$$$ is adjacent to island $$$i+1$$$, for $$$1 \leq i < N$$$. Between adjacent islands $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$, there is a pair of one-directional underwater tunnels: one that allows you to walk from island $$$i$$$ to island $$$i+1$$$ and one for the opposite direction. Each tunnel can only be traversed at most once.

You also have a dragon with you. It has a stamina represented by a non-negative integer. The stamina is required for the dragon to perform its abilities: swim and fly. Initially, its stamina is $$$0$$$.

Your dragon's stamina can be increased as follows. There is a magical shrine on each island $$$i$$$ that will immediately increase your dragon's stamina by $$$P_i$$$ (regardless the position of the dragon) when you visit island $$$i$$$ for the first time. This event takes no time.

When you are on an island, there are $$$3$$$ moves that you can perform.

- Swim with your dragon to an adjacent island if your dragon and you are on the same island. You can perform if your dragon's stamina is at least $$$D$$$. This move reduces your dragon's stamina by $$$D$$$, and it takes $$$T_s$$$ seconds to perform.
- Fly with your dragon to an adjacent island if your dragon and you are on the same island. You can perform this move if your dragon's stamina is not $$$0$$$. This move sets your dragon's stamina to $$$0$$$, and it takes $$$T_f$$$ seconds to perform.
- Walk alone without your dragon to an adjacent island through the underwater tunnel. This move takes $$$T_w$$$ seconds to perform. Once you walk through this tunnel, it cannot be used again.

Note that both swimming and flying do not use tunnels.

Your dragon and you are currently on island $$$1$$$. Your mission is to go to island $$$N$$$ with your dragon. Determine the minimum possible time to complete your mission.

Input and Output Format:
The first line consists of five integers $$$N$$$ $$$D$$$ $$$T_s$$$ $$$T_f$$$ $$$T_w$$$ ($$$2 \leq N \leq 200\,000; 1 \leq D, T_s, T_f, T_w \leq 200\,000$$$).

The second line consists of $$$N$$$ integers $$$P_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq P_i \leq 200\,000)$$$.

Output an integer in a single line representing the minimum possible time to go to island $$$N$$$ with your dragon.

You received an intel that there will be monster attacks on a narrow passageway near the kingdom. The narrow passageway can be represented as a grid with $$$2$$$ rows (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$) and $$$N$$$ columns (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$). Denote $$$(r, c)$$$ as the cell in row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$. A soldier with a power of $$$P_{r, c}$$$ is assigned to protect $$$(r, c)$$$ every single day.

It is known that the passageway is very foggy. Within a day, each column in the passageway has a $$$50\%$$$ chance of being covered in fog. If a column is covered in fog, the two soldiers assigned to that column are not deployed that day. Otherwise, the assigned soldiers will be deployed.

Define a connected area $$$[u, v]$$$ ($$$u \leq v$$$) as a maximal set of consecutive columns from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ (inclusive) such that each column in the set is not covered in fog. The following illustration is an example of connected areas. The grayed cells are cells covered in fog. There are $$$4$$$ connected areas: $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[4, 6]$$$, $$$[9, 9]$$$, and $$$[11, 11]$$$.

The strength of a connected area $$$[u, v]$$$ can be calculated as follows. Let $$$m_1$$$ and $$$m_2$$$ be the maximum power of the soldiers in the first and second rows of the connected area, respectively. Formally, $$$m_r = \max (P_{r, u}, P_{r, u + 1}, \dots, P_{r, v})$$$ for $$$r \in \{ 1, 2\}$$$. If $$$m_1 = m_2$$$, then the strength is $$$0$$$. Otherwise, the strength is $$$\min (m_1, m_2)$$$.

The total strength of the deployment is the sum of the strengths for all connected areas. Determine the expected total strength of the deployment on any single day.

Input and Output Format:
The first line consists of an integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \leq N \leq 100\,000$$$).

Each of the next two lines consists of $$$N$$$ integers $$$P_{r, c}$$$ ($$$1 \leq P_{r, c} \leq 200\,000$$$).

Let $$$M = 998\,244\,353$$$. It can be shown that the expected total strength can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{x}{y}$$$ such that $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are integers and $$$y \not\equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output an integer $$$k$$$ in a single line such that $$$0 \leq k < M$$$ and $$$k \cdot y \equiv x \pmod{M}$$$.

As the gamemaster, you set up a triangular grid of size $$$N$$$. The grid has $$$N$$$ rows (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$). Row $$$r$$$ has $$$r$$$ cells; the $$$c$$$-th cell of row $$$r$$$ is denoted as $$$(r, c)$$$.

Before the game starts, $$$M$$$ different cells (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$M$$$) are chosen: at cell $$$(R_i, C_i)$$$, you add $$$A_i$$$ stones on it. You then give Anda and Kamu an integer $$$K$$$ and commence the game.

Anda and Kamu will take turns alternately with Anda taking the first turn. A player on their turn will do the following.

- Choose a cell $$$(r, c)$$$ with at least one stone on it.
- Remove at least one but at most $$$K$$$ stones from the chosen cell.
- For each cell $$$(x, y)$$$ such that $$$r + 1 \leq x \leq \min(N, r + K)$$$ and $$$c \leq y \leq c + x - r$$$, add zero or more stones but at most $$$K$$$ stones to cell $$$(x, y)$$$.

The following illustrations show all the possible cells in which you can add stones for $$$K = 3$$$. You choose the cell $$$(2, 1)$$$ for the left illustration and the cell $$$(4, 3)$$$ for the right illustration.

A player who is unable to complete their turn (because there are no more stones on the grid) will lose the game, and the opposing player wins. Determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

Input and Output Format:
This problem is a multi-case problem. The first line consists of an integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \leq T \leq 100$$$) that represents the number of test cases.

Each test case starts with a single line consisting of three integers $$$N$$$ $$$M$$$ $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \leq N \leq 10^9; 1 \leq M, K \leq 200\,000$$$). Then, each of the next $$$M$$$ lines consists of three integers $$$R_i$$$ $$$C_i$$$ $$$A_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq C_i \leq R_i \leq N; 1 \leq A_1 \leq 10^9$$$). The pairs $$$(R_i, C_i)$$$ are distinct.

The sum of $$$M$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$200\,000$$$.

For each case, output a string in a single line representing the player who will win the game if both players play optimally. Output Anda if Anda, the first player, wins. Otherwise, output Kamu.

The cell located at row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ is denoted as $$$(r, c)$$$ and has a height of $$$H_{r, c}$$$. Two cells are adjacent to each other if they share a side. Formally, $$$(r, c)$$$ is adjacent to $$$(r-1, c)$$$, $$$(r+1, c)$$$, $$$(r, c-1)$$$, and $$$(r, c+1)$$$, if any exists.

You can move only between adjacent cells, and each move comes with a penalty. With an aura of an odd positive integer $$$X$$$, moving from a cell with height $$$h_1$$$ to a cell with height $$$h_2$$$ gives you a penalty of $$$(h_1 - h_2)^X$$$. Note that the penalty can be negative.

You want to answer $$$Q$$$ independent scenarios. In each scenario, you start at the starting cell $$$(R_s, C_s)$$$ and you want to go to the destination cell $$$(R_f, C_f)$$$ with minimum total penalty. In some scenarios, the total penalty might become arbitrarily small; such a scenario is called invalid. Find the minimum total penalty to move from the starting cell to the destination cell, or determine if the scenario is invalid.

Input and Output Format:
The first line consists of three integers $$$R$$$ $$$C$$$ $$$X$$$ ($$$1 \leq R, C \leq 1000; 1 \leq X \leq 9; X$$$ is an odd integer).

Each of the next $$$R$$$ lines consists of a string $$$H_r$$$ of length $$$C$$$. Each character in $$$H_r$$$ is a number from 0 to 9. The $$$c$$$-th character of $$$H_r$$$ represents the height of cell $$$(r, c)$$$, or $$$H_{r, c}$$$.

The next line consists of an integer $$$Q$$$ ($$$1 \leq Q \leq 100\,000)$$$.

Each of the next $$$Q$$$ lines consists of four integers $$$R_s$$$ $$$C_s$$$ $$$R_f$$$ $$$C_f$$$ ($$$1 \leq R_s, R_f \leq R; 1 \leq C_s, C_f \leq C$$$).

For each scenario, output the following in a single line. If the scenario is invalid, output INVALID. Otherwise, output a single integer representing the minimum total penalty to move from the starting cell to the destination cell.

You want to print this dictionary. However, there is a bug with the printing system, and all words in the list are printed next to each other without any separators between words. Now, you ended up with a string $$$S$$$ that is a concatenation of all the words in the dictionary in the listed order.

Your task is to reconstruct the dictionary by splitting $$$S$$$ into one or more words. Note that the reconstructed dictionary must consist of distinct words sorted in alphabetical order. Furthermore, you want to maximize the number of words in the dictionary. If there are several possible dictionaries with the maximum number of words, you can choose any of them.

Input and Output Format:

First, output an integer in a single line representing the maximum number of the words in the reconstructed dictionary. Denote this number as $$$n$$$.

Then, output $$$n$$$ lines, each containing a single string representing the word. The words must be distinct, and the list must be sorted alphabetically. The concatenation of the words in the listed order must equal $$$S$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an array of $$$N$$$ integers: $$$[A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N]$$$.

A subsequence can be derived from an array by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, $$$[2, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 3]$$$, $$$[1]$$$, and $$$[3, 2, 1, 3, 2]$$$ are subsequences of array $$$[3, 2, 1, 3, 2]$$$, while $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ is not a subsequence of array $$$[3, 2, 1, 3, 2]$$$.

A subsequence is microwavable if the subsequence consists of at most two distinct values and each element differs from its adjacent elements. For example, $$$[2, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 3, 2]$$$, and $$$[1]$$$ are microwavable, while $$$[3, 3]$$$ and $$$[3, 2, 1, 3, 2]$$$ are not microwavable.

Denote a function $$$f(x, y)$$$ as the length of the longest microwavable subsequence of array $$$A$$$ such that each element within the subsequence is either $$$x$$$ or $$$y$$$. Find the sum of $$$f(x, y)$$$ for all $$$1 \leq x < y \leq M$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line consists of two integers $$$N$$$ $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \leq N, M \leq 300\,000$$$).

There are $$$N$$$ cards (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$). Card $$$i$$$ has the value of $$$A_i$$$, which is an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$N$$$ (inclusive).

The game consists of $$$N$$$ rounds (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$). Within each round, you need to build two non-empty decks, deck $$$1$$$ and deck $$$2$$$. A card cannot be inside both decks, and it is allowed to not use all $$$N$$$ cards. In round $$$i$$$, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the card values in each deck must equal $$$i$$$.

Your creativity point during round $$$i$$$ is the product of $$$i$$$ and the number of ways to build two valid decks. Two ways are considered different if one of the decks contains different cards.

Find the sum of creativity points across all $$$N$$$ rounds. Since the sum can be very large, calculate the sum modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are currently studying a graph traversal algorithm called the Depth First Search (DFS). However, due to a bug, your algorithm is slightly different from the standard DFS. The following is an algorithm for your Buggy DFS (BDFS), assuming the graph has $$$N$$$ nodes (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$).

You realized that the bug made the algorithm slower than standard DFS, which can be investigated by the return value of the function BDFS(). To investigate the behavior of this algorithm, you want to make some test cases by constructing an undirected simple graph such that the function BDFS() returns $$$K$$$, or determine if it is impossible to do so.

Input and Output Format:
A single line consisting of an integer $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \leq K \leq 10^9$$$).

If it is impossible to construct an undirected simple graph such that the function BDFS() returns $$$K$$$, then output -1 -1 in a single line.

Otherwise, output the graph in the following format. The first line consists of two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$, representing the number of nodes and undirected edges in the graph, respectively. Each of the next $$$M$$$ lines consists of two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, representing an undirected edge that connects node $$$u$$$ and node $$$v$$$. You are allowed to output the edges in any order. This graph has to satisfy the following constraints:

- $$$1 \leq N \leq 32\,768$$$
- $$$1 \leq M \leq 65\,536$$$
- $$$1 \leq u, v \leq N$$$, for all edges.
- The graph is a simple graph, i.e. there are no multi-edges nor self-loops.

Note that you are not required to minimize the number of nodes or edges. It can be proven that if constructing a graph in which the return value of BDFS() is $$$K$$$ is possible, then there exists one that satisfies all the constraints above. If there are several solutions, you can output any of them.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given a grid of $$$R$$$ rows (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$R$$$ from north to south) and $$$C$$$ columns (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$C$$$ from west to east). Every cell in this grid is a square of the same size. The cell located at row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ is denoted as $$$(r, c)$$$. Each cell can either be empty or have a mirror in one of the cell's diagonals. Each mirror is represented by a line segment. The mirror is type $$$1$$$ if it is positioned diagonally from the southwest corner to the northeast corner of the cell, or type $$$2$$$ for the other diagonal.

These mirrors follow the law of reflection, that is, the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. Formally, for type $$$1$$$ mirror, if a beam of light comes from the north, south, west, or east of the cell, then it will be reflected to the west, east, north, and south of the cell, respectively. Similarly, for type $$$2$$$ mirror, if a beam of light comes from the north, south, west, or east of the cell, then it will be reflected to the east, west, south, and north of the cell, respectively.

You want to put a laser from outside the grid such that all mirrors are hit by the laser beam. There are $$$2 \cdot (R+C)$$$ possible locations to put the laser:

- from the north side of the grid at column $$$c$$$, for $$$1 \leq c \leq C$$$, shooting a laser beam to the south;
- from the south side of the grid at column $$$c$$$, for $$$1 \leq c \leq C$$$, shooting a laser beam to the north;
- from the east side of the grid at row $$$r$$$, for $$$1 \leq r \leq R$$$, shooting a laser beam to the west; and
- from the west side of the grid at row $$$r$$$, for $$$1 \leq r \leq R$$$, shooting a laser beam to the east.

Determine all possible locations for the laser such that all mirrors are hit by the laser beam.

Input and Output Format:
The first line consists of two integers $$$R$$$ $$$C$$$ ($$$1 \leq R, C \leq 200$$$).

Each of the next $$$R$$$ lines consists of a string $$$S_r$$$ of length $$$C$$$. The $$$c$$$-th character of string $$$S_r$$$ represents cell $$$(r, c)$$$. Each character can either be . if the cell is empty, / if the cell has type $$$1$$$ mirror, or \ if the cell has type $$$2$$$ mirror. There is at least one mirror in the grid.

Output a single integer representing the number of possible locations for the laser such that all mirrors are hit by the laser beam. Denote this number as $$$k$$$.

If $$$k > 0$$$, then output $$$k$$$ space-separated strings representing the location of the laser. Each string consists of a character followed without any space by an integer. The character represents the side of the grid, which could be N, S, E, or W if you put the laser on the north, south, east, or west side of the grid, respectively. The integer represents the row/column number. You can output the strings in any order.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are coloring an infinite square grid, in which all cells are initially white. To do this, you are given $$$n$$$ stamps. Each stamp is a rectangle of width $$$w_i$$$ and height $$$h_i$$$.

You will use each stamp exactly once to color a rectangle of the same size as the stamp on the grid in black. You cannot rotate the stamp, and for each cell, the stamp must either cover it fully or not cover it at all. You can use the stamp at any position on the grid, even if some or all of the cells covered by the stamping area are already black.

What is the minimum sum of the perimeters of the connected regions of black squares you can obtain after all the stamps have been used?

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$).

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$w_i$$$ and $$$h_i$$$ ($$$1 \le w_i, h_i \le 100$$$).

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum sum of the perimeters of the connected regions of black squares you can obtain after all the stamps have been used.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Stalin Sort is a humorous sorting algorithm designed to eliminate elements which are out of place instead of bothering to sort them properly, lending itself to an $$$\mathcal{O}(n)$$$ time complexity.

It goes as follows: starting from the second element in the array, if it is strictly smaller than the previous element (ignoring those which have already been deleted), then delete it. Continue iterating through the array until it is sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, the array $$$[1, 4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 5, 7, 7]$$$ becomes $$$[1, 4, 6, 7, 7]$$$ after a Stalin Sort.

We define an array as vulnerable if you can sort it in non-increasing order by repeatedly applying a Stalin Sort to any of its subarrays$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$, as many times as is needed.

Given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, determine the minimum number of integers which must be removed from the array to make it vulnerable.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2000$$$) — the size of the array.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of integers which must be removed from the array to make it vulnerable.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the hard version of this problem. The only difference is that you need to output the number of choices of games where Bob wins in this version, where the number of stones in each pile are not fixed. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.

Alice and Bob are playing a familiar game where they take turns removing stones from $$$n$$$ piles. Initially, there are $$$x_i$$$ stones in the $$$i$$$-th pile, and it has an associated value $$$a_i$$$. A player can take $$$d$$$ stones away from the $$$i$$$-th pile if and only if both of the following conditions are met:

- $$$1 \le d \le a_i$$$, and
- $$$x \, \& \, d = d$$$, where $$$x$$$ is the current number of stones in the $$$i$$$-th pile and $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.

The player who cannot make a move loses, and Alice goes first.

You're given the $$$a_i$$$ values of each pile, but the number of stones in the $$$i$$$-th pile has not been determined yet. For the $$$i$$$-th pile, $$$x_i$$$ can be any integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$b_i$$$, inclusive. That is, you can choose an array $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$ such that the condition $$$1 \le x_i \le b_i$$$ is satisfied for all piles.

Your task is to count the number of games where Bob wins if both players play optimally. Two games are considered different if the number of stones in any pile is different, i.e., the arrays of $$$x$$$ differ in at least one position.

Since the answer can be very large, please output the result modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^4$$$) — the number of piles.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i < 2^{30}$$$).

The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i < 2^{30}$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

Output a single integer, the number of games where Bob wins, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Farmer John's $$$n$$$ cows are playing a card game! Farmer John has a deck of $$$n \cdot m$$$ cards numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n \cdot m-1$$$. He distributes $$$m$$$ cards to each of his $$$n$$$ cows.

Farmer John wants the game to be fair, so each cow should only be able to play $$$1$$$ card per round. He decides to determine a turn order, determined by a permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, such that the $$$p_i$$$'th cow will be the $$$i$$$'th cow to place a card on top of the center pile in a round.

In other words, the following events happen in order in each round:

- The $$$p_1$$$'th cow places any card from their deck on top of the center pile.
- The $$$p_2$$$'th cow places any card from their deck on top of the center pile.
- ...
- The $$$p_n$$$'th cow places any card from their deck on top of the center pile.

There is a catch. Initially, the center pile contains a card numbered $$$-1$$$. In order to place a card, the number of the card must be greater than the number of the card on top of the center pile. Then, the newly placed card becomes the top card of the center pile. If a cow cannot place any card in their deck, the game is considered to be lost.

Farmer John wonders: does there exist $$$p$$$ such that it is possible for all of his cows to empty their deck after playing all $$$m$$$ rounds of the game? If so, output any valid $$$p$$$. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 400$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \cdot m \leq 2\,000$$$) — the number of cows and the number of cards each cow receives.

The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ integers each – the cards received by each cow. It is guaranteed all given numbers (across all $$$n$$$ lines) are distinct and in the range from $$$0$$$ to $$$n \cdot m - 1$$$, inclusive.

It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\,000$$$.

For each test case, output the following on a new line:

- If $$$p$$$ exists, output $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$.
- Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You're given integers $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$. For each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, count the number of integer arrays $$$a$$$ such that all of the following are satisfied:

- $$$1 \leq |a| \leq n$$$ where $$$|a|$$$ represents the length of $$$a$$$.
- $$$1 \leq a_i \leq k$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq |a|$$$.
- $$$a_1 \times a_2 \times \dots \times a_{|a|}=x$$$ (i.e., the product of all elements is $$$x$$$).

Note that two arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are different if either their lengths are different, or if there exists an index $$$1 \leq i \leq |b|$$$ such that $$$b_i\neq c_i$$$.

Output the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of independent test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq 10^5, 1\leq n \leq 9\cdot 10^8$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$k$$$ space-separated integers on a new line: the number of arrays for $$$x=1,2,\ldots,k$$$, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Today, Alice has given Bob arrays for him to sort in increasing order again! At this point, no one really knows how many times she has done this.

Bob is given two sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. All integers in the range from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ appear exactly once in either $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$. In other words, the concatenated$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ sequence $$$a+b$$$ is a permutation$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of length $$$2n$$$.

Bob must sort both sequences in increasing order at the same time using Alice's swap function. Alice's swap function is implemented as follows:

- Given two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \neq j$$$), it swaps $$$a_i$$$ with $$$b_j$$$, and swaps $$$b_i$$$ with $$$a_j$$$.

Given sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, please determine if both sequences can be sorted in increasing order simultaneously after using Alice's swap function any number of times.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2n$$$).

The third line of each test case contains $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 2n$$$).

It is guaranteed that all integers in the range $$$[1,2n]$$$ appear exactly once in either $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

If it is possible to sort both sequences simultaneously, print "YES" on a new line. Otherwise, print "NO" on a new line.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will also be recognized as positive responses.

Monocarp can train on any day he wants. However, Stereocarp watches Monocarp and follows a different schedule: if Monocarp trained on day $$$i$$$ and $$$i < n$$$, then Stereocarp will train on day $$$(i+1)$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Monocarp is preparing for his first exam at the university. There are $$$n$$$ different questions which can be asked during the exam, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. There are $$$m$$$ different lists of questions; each list consists of exactly $$$n-1$$$ different questions. Each list $$$i$$$ is characterized by one integer $$$a_i$$$, which is the index of the only question which is not present in the $$$i$$$-th list. For example, if $$$n = 4$$$ and $$$a_i = 3$$$, the $$$i$$$-th list contains questions $$$[1, 2, 4]$$$.

During the exam, Monocarp will receive one of these $$$m$$$ lists of questions. Then, the professor will make Monocarp answer all questions from the list. So, Monocarp will pass only if he knows all questions from the list.

Monocarp knows the answers for $$$k$$$ questions $$$q_1, q_2, \dots, q_k$$$. For each list, determine if Monocarp will pass the exam if he receives that list.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

- the first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le m, k \le n$$$);
- the second line contains $$$m$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$; $$$a_i < a_{i+1}$$$);
- the third line contains $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$q_1, q_2, \dots, q_k$$$ ($$$1 \le q_i \le n$$$; $$$q_i < q_{i+1}$$$).

Additional constraints on the input:

- the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print a string of $$$m$$$ characters. The $$$i$$$-th character should be 1 if Monocarp passes the exam if he receives the $$$i$$$-th question list, 0 if Monocarp won't pass.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given a sequence $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th element of the sequence is equal to $$$a_i$$$. You are also given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x \le y$$$).

A pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ is considered interesting if the following conditions are met:

- $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$;
- if you simultaneously remove the elements at positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ from the sequence $$$a$$$, the sum of the remaining elements is at least $$$x$$$ and at most $$$y$$$.

Your task is to determine the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence $$$a$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

- The first line contains three integers $$$n, x, y$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le x \le y \le 2 \cdot 10^{14}$$$);
- The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^{9}$$$).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output one integer — the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence $$$a$$$.

Before the sales begin, the store needs to determine the price for one tree (the price is the same for all customers). To do this, the store has some information about each customer.

For the $$$i$$$-th customer, two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ are known, which define their behavior:

- if the price of the product is at most $$$a_i$$$, the customer will buy a tree and leave a positive review;
- otherwise, if the price of the product is at most $$$b_i$$$, the customer will buy a tree but leave a negative review;
- otherwise, the customer will not buy a tree at all.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible earnings for the store, given that it can receive no more than $$$k$$$ negative reviews.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \le k \le n$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9$$$).

The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9$$$; $$$a_i < b_i$$$).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

$$$q$$$ operations are applied sequentially to the deck. During the $$$i$$$-th operation, you need to take the card at position $$$a_i$$$ and move it either to the beginning or to the end of the deck. For example, if the deck is $$$[2, 1, 3, 5, 4]$$$, and $$$a_i=2$$$, then after the operation the deck will be either $$$[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]$$$ (the card from the second position moved to the beginning) or $$$[2, 3, 5, 4, 1]$$$ (the card from the second position moved to the end).

You have $$$n$$$ snakes (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) you need to place into some cells. Initially, each snake occupies exactly one cell, and you can't place more than one snake into one cell. After that, the game starts.

The game lasts for $$$q$$$ seconds. There are two types of events that may happen each second:

- snake $$$s_i$$$ enlarges: if snake $$$s_i$$$ occupied cells $$$[l, r]$$$, it enlarges to a segment $$$[l, r + 1]$$$;
- snake $$$s_i$$$ shrinks: if snake $$$s_i$$$ occupied cells $$$[l, r]$$$, it shrinks to a segment $$$[l + 1, r]$$$.

Each second, exactly one of the events happens.

If at any moment of time, any snake runs into some obstacle (either another snake or the end of the strip), you lose. Otherwise, you win with the score equal to the maximum cell occupied by any snake so far.

What is the minimum possible score you can achieve?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 20$$$; $$$1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of snakes and the number of events. Next $$$q$$$ lines contain the description of events — one per line.

The $$$i$$$-th line contains

- either "$$$s_i$$$ +" ($$$1 \le s_i \le n$$$) meaning that the $$$s_i$$$-th snake enlarges
- or "$$$s_i$$$ -" ($$$1 \le s_i \le n$$$) meaning that the $$$s_i$$$-th snake shrinks.

Additional constraint on the input: the given sequence of events is valid, i. e. a snake of length $$$1$$$ never shrinks.

If $$$a_{i,j} < 0$$$, then there is a lake there.

Kosuke is very afraid of water, so Sakurako needs to help him:

- With her magic, she can select a square area of mountains and increase the height of each mountain on the main diagonal of that area by exactly one.

More formally, she can choose a submatrix with the upper left corner located at $$$(i, j)$$$ and the lower right corner at $$$(p, q)$$$, such that $$$p-i=q-j$$$. She can then add one to each element at the intersection of the $$$(i + k)$$$-th row and the $$$(j + k)$$$-th column, for all $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \le k \le p-i$$$.

Determine the minimum number of times Sakurako must use her magic so that there are no lakes.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 200$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case is described as follows:

- The first line of each test case consists of a single number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 500$$$).
- Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines consists of $$$n$$$ integers separated by spaces, which correspond to the heights of the mountains in the valley $$$a$$$ ($$$-10^5 \le a_{i,j} \le 10^5$$$).

That is why Sakurakos teacher decided to go on a field trip. It is known that all of the students will be walking in one line. The student with index $$$i$$$ has some topic of interest which is described as $$$a_i$$$. As a teacher, you want to minimise the disturbance of the line of students.

The disturbance of the line is defined as the number of neighbouring people with the same topic of interest. In other words, disturbance is the number of indices $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j < n$$$) such that $$$a_j = a_{j + 1}$$$.

In order to do this, you can choose index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$) and swap students at positions $$$i$$$ and $$$n-i+1$$$. You can perform any number of swaps.

Your task is to determine the minimal amount of disturbance that you can achieve by doing the operation described above any number of times.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case is described by two lines.

As a reward, she received a permutation $$$p$$$. Kosuke was not entirely satisfied because he failed one exam and did not receive a gift. He decided to sneak into her room (thanks to the code for her lock) and spoil the permutation so that it becomes simple.

A permutation $$$p$$$ is considered simple if for every $$$i$$$ $$$(1\le i \le n)$$$ one of the following conditions holds:

- $$$p_i=i$$$
- $$$p_{p_i}=i$$$

For example, the permutations $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$, $$$[5, 2, 4, 3, 1]$$$, and $$$[2, 1]$$$ are simple, while $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$ and $$$[5, 2, 1, 4, 3]$$$ are not.

In one operation, Kosuke can choose indices $$$i,j$$$ $$$(1\le i,j\le n)$$$ and swap the elements $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$.

Sakurako is about to return home. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations that Kosuke needs to perform to make the permutation simple.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case is described by two lines.

Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:

- $$$f(1)=f(2)=1$$$.
- $$$f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)$$$ $$$(3\le n)$$$

As this number can be too big, output it by modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

For example: $$$G(3,2)=9$$$ because the $$$3$$$-rd Fibonacci number that is divisible by $$$2$$$ is $$$34$$$. $$$[1,1,\textbf{2},3,5,\textbf{8},13,21,\textbf{34}]$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10^5$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output the only number: the value $$$G(n,k)$$$ taken by modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

To help Sakurako, Kosuke recorded his $$$q$$$ guesses. In the $$$i$$$-th guess, he assumes that Chefir got lost at vertex $$$v_i$$$ and had $$$k_i$$$ stamina.

Also, for each guess, Kosuke assumes that Chefir could move along the edges an arbitrary number of times:

- from vertex $$$a$$$ to vertex $$$b$$$, if $$$a$$$ is an ancestor$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$b$$$, the stamina will not change;
- from vertex $$$a$$$ to vertex $$$b$$$, if $$$a$$$ is not an ancestor of $$$b$$$, then Chefir's stamina decreases by $$$1$$$.

If Chefir's stamina is $$$0$$$, he cannot make a move of the second type.

For each assumption, your task is to find the distance to the farthest vertex that Chefir could reach from vertex $$$v_i$$$, having $$$k_i$$$ stamina.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case is described as follows:

- The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.
- The next $$$n-1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
- The next line consists of a single integer $$$q$$$ $$$(1\le q\le 2 \cdot 10^5)$$$, which denotes the number of guesses made by Kosuke.
- The next $$$q$$$ lines describe the guesses made by Kosuke, with two integers $$$v_i$$$, $$$k_i$$$ $$$(1\le v_i \le n, 0 \le k_i\le n)$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case and for each guess, output the maximum distance to the farthest vertex that Chefir could reach from the starting point $$$v_i$$$ having $$$k_i$$$ stamina.

Evirir the dragon found an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers.

In one operation, they can choose a non-empty subarray$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$b$$$ of $$$a$$$ and replace it with the integer $$$\operatorname{mex}(b)$$$$$$^{\text{†}}$$$. They want to use this operation any number of times to make $$$a$$$ only contain zeros. It can be proven that this is always possible under the problem constraints.

What is the minimum number of operations needed?

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 200$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 50$$$), the length of $$$a$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 100$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer on a line, the minimum number of operations needed to make $$$a$$$ contain only zeros.

You are given a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns of non-negative integers and an integer $$$k$$$. Let $$$(i, j)$$$ denote the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row from the top and $$$j$$$-th column from the left ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le j \le m$$$). For every cell $$$(i, j)$$$, the integer $$$a_{i, j}$$$ is written on the cell $$$(i, j)$$$.

You are initially at $$$(1, 1)$$$ and want to go to $$$(n, m)$$$. You may only move down or right. That is, if you are at $$$(i, j)$$$, you can only move to $$$(i+1, j)$$$ or $$$(i, j+1)$$$ (if the corresponding cell exists).

Before you begin moving, you may do the following operation any number of times:

- Choose an integer $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ and cyclically shift row $$$i$$$ to the left by $$$1$$$. Formally, simultaneously set $$$a_{i,j}$$$ to $$$a_{i,(j \bmod m) + 1}$$$ for all integers $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le m$$$).

After moving from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, m)$$$, let $$$x$$$ be the number of operations you have performed before moving, and let $$$y$$$ be the sum of the integers written on visited cells (including $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(n, m)$$$). Then the cost is defined as $$$kx + y$$$.

Find the minimum cost to move from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, m)$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

Then, $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$m$$$ space-separated integers, $$$a_{i,1},\,a_{i,2},\,\ldots,\,a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^4$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You, a wizard whose creation was destroyed by a dragon, are determined to hunt it down with a magical AOE tracker. But it seems to be toyed with...

This is an interactive problem.

There is a hidden binary array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$\mathbf{n}$$$ is a power of 2) and a hidden integer $$$k\ (2 \le k \le n - 1)$$$. The array $$$a$$$ contains exactly one 1 (and all other elements are 0). For two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$), define the range sum $$$s(l, r) = a_l + a_{l+1} + \cdots + a_r$$$.

You have a magical device that takes ranges and returns range sums, but it returns the opposite result when the range has length at least $$$k$$$. Formally, in one query, you can give it a pair of integers $$$[l, r]$$$ where $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$, and it will return either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ according to the following rules:

- If $$$r - l + 1 < k$$$, it will return $$$s(l, r)$$$.
- If $$$r - l + 1 \ge k$$$, it will return $$$1 - s(l, r)$$$.

Find $$$k$$$ using at most $$$33$$$ queries.

The device is not adaptive. It means that the hidden $$$a$$$ and $$$k$$$ are fixed before the interaction and will not change during the interaction.

Here, $$$\operatorname{mex(c)}$$$ denotes the MEX$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of the collection $$$c$$$, and $$$|$$$ is the bitwise OR operator.

Shohag has an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. He will perform the following $$$q$$$ updates on $$$a$$$:

- $$$i$$$ $$$x$$$ — increase $$$a_i$$$ by $$$x$$$.

After each update, help him find the length of the longest good subarray$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of $$$a$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 10^5$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le n$$$).

The next $$$q$$$ lines of each test case are of the following form:

- $$$i$$$ $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le i, x \le n$$$) — it means you should increase $$$a_i$$$ by $$$x$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$q$$$ lines — on the $$$i$$$-th line output the length of the longest good subarray of $$$a$$$ after the $$$i$$$-th update.

Please note that the swaps are persistent through queries.

$$$^\dagger$$$ A perfect binary tree is a tree with vertex $$$1$$$ as its root, with size $$$n=2^k-1$$$ for a positive integer $$$k$$$, and where the parent of each vertex $$$i$$$ ($$$1<i\le n$$$) is $$$\left\lfloor\frac{i}{2}\right\rfloor$$$.

The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\le p_i\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the initial permutation $$$p$$$.

The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1\le x,y\le n,x\neq y$$$) — the positions of the elements to swap in the permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$65\,535$$$, and the sum of all $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^4$$$.

For each test case, print $$$q$$$ lines corresponding to the $$$q$$$ queries. For each query, output $$$\texttt{YES}$$$ if there is a DFS order that exactly equals the current permutation, and output $$$\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise.

You can output $$$\texttt{Yes}$$$ and $$$\texttt{No}$$$ in any case (for example, strings $$$\texttt{yEs}$$$, $$$\texttt{yes}$$$, $$$\texttt{Yes}$$$ and $$$\texttt{YES}$$$ will be recognized as a positive response).

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, you are given a generic tree and the constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ are higher. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

You are given a rooted tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and the root is the vertex $$$1$$$. You are also given a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ of $$$[1,2,\ldots,n]$$$.

You need to answer $$$q$$$ queries. For each query, you are given two integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$; you need to swap $$$p_x$$$ and $$$p_y$$$ and determine if $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ is a valid DFS order$$$^\dagger$$$ of the given tree.

Please note that the swaps are persistent through queries.

$$$^\dagger$$$ A DFS order is found by calling the following $$$\texttt{dfs}$$$ function on the given tree.

Note that the DFS order is not unique.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The next line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i<i$$$) — the parent of each vertex in the given tree.

The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\le p_i\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the initial permutation $$$p$$$.

The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1\le x,y\le n,x\neq y$$$) — the positions of the elements to swap in the permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$3\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of all $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, print $$$q$$$ lines corresponding to the $$$q$$$ queries. For each query, output $$$\texttt{YES}$$$ if there is a DFS order that exactly equals the current permutation, and output $$$\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise.

Define the strength of an array as the number of seconds it takes to become empty.

You are given an array of integers compressed in the form of $$$n$$$ pairs that describe the array left to right. Each pair $$$(a_i,b_i)$$$ represents $$$a_i$$$ copies of $$$b_i$$$, i.e. $$$\underbrace{b_i,b_i,\cdots,b_i}_{a_i\textrm{ times}}$$$.

For each $$$i=1,2,\dots,n$$$, please find the strength of the sequence described by the first $$$i$$$ pairs.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le3\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of sequence $$$a$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. In this version, $$$n=m$$$ and the time limit is lower. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

In the court of the Blue King, Lelle and Flamm are having a performance match. The match consists of several rounds. In each round, either Lelle or Flamm wins.

Let $$$W_L$$$ and $$$W_F$$$ denote the number of wins of Lelle and Flamm, respectively. The Blue King considers a match to be successful if and only if:

- after every round, $$$\gcd(W_L,W_F)\le 1$$$;
- at the end of the match, $$$W_L\le n, W_F\le m$$$.

Note that $$$\gcd(0,x)=\gcd(x,0)=x$$$ for every non-negative integer $$$x$$$.

Lelle and Flamm can decide to stop the match whenever they want, and the final score of the performance is $$$l \cdot W_L + f \cdot W_F$$$.

Please help Lelle and Flamm coordinate their wins and losses such that the performance is successful, and the total score of the performance is maximized.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: It's been a long summer's day, with the constant chirping of cicadas and the heat which never seemed to end. Finally, it has drawn to a close. The showdown has passed, the gates are open, and only a gentle breeze is left behind.

Your predecessors had taken their final bow; it's your turn to take the stage.

Sorting through some notes that were left behind, you found a curious statement named Problem 101:

- Given a positive integer sequence $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$, you can operate on it any number of times. In an operation, you choose three consecutive elements $$$a_i,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}$$$, and merge them into one element $$$\max(a_i+1,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}+1)$$$. Please calculate the maximum number of operations you can do without creating an element greater than $$$m$$$.

After some thought, you decided to propose the following problem, named Counting 101:

- Given $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. For each $$$k=0,1,\ldots,\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor$$$, please find the number of integer sequences $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ with elements in $$$[1, m]$$$, such that when used as input for Problem 101, the answer is $$$k$$$. As the answer can be very large, please print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 130$$$, $$$1\le m\le 30$$$).

For each test case, output $$$\left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{2}\right\rfloor$$$ numbers. The $$$i$$$-th number is the number of valid sequences such that when used as input for Problem 101, the answer is $$$i-1$$$, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

There are $$$n$$$ lilypads arranged in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Alice and Bob are frogs initially positioned on distinct lilypads, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, respectively. They take turns jumping, starting with Alice.

During a frog's turn, it can jump either one space to the left or one space to the right, as long as the destination lilypad exists. For example, on Alice's first turn, she can jump to either lilypad $$$a-1$$$ or $$$a+1$$$, provided these lilypads are within bounds. It is important to note that each frog must jump during its turn and cannot remain on the same lilypad.

However, there are some restrictions:

- The two frogs cannot occupy the same lilypad. This means that Alice cannot jump to a lilypad that Bob is currently occupying, and vice versa.
- If a frog cannot make a valid jump on its turn, it loses the game. As a result, the other frog wins.

Determine whether Alice can guarantee a win, assuming that both players play optimally. It can be proven that the game will end after a finite number of moves if both players play optimally.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 100$$$, $$$1 \leq a, b \leq n$$$, $$$a\neq b$$$) — the number of lilypads, and the starting positions of Alice and Bob, respectively.

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.

For each test case, print a single line containing either "YES" or "NO", representing whether or not Alice has a winning strategy.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: As you'd expect, Florida is home to many bizarre magical forces, and Florida Man seeks to tame them.

There are $$$n$$$ different types of magical materials, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Initially, you have $$$a_i$$$ units of material $$$i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You are allowed to perform the following operation:

- Select a material $$$i$$$ (where $$$1\le i\le n$$$). Then, spend $$$1$$$ unit of every other material $$$j$$$ (in other words, $$$j\neq i$$$) to gain $$$1$$$ unit of material $$$i$$$. More formally, after selecting material $$$i$$$, update array $$$a$$$ as follows: $$$a_i := a_i + 1$$$, and $$$a_j := a_j - 1$$$ for all $$$j$$$ where $$$j\neq i$$$ and $$$1\le j\le n$$$. Note that all $$$a_j$$$ must remain non-negative, i.e. you cannot spend resources you do not have.

You are trying to craft an artifact using these materials. To successfully craft the artifact, you must have at least $$$b_i$$$ units of material $$$i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Determine if it is possible to craft the artifact by performing the operation any number of times (including zero).

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of types of materials.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i\le 10^9$$$) — the amount of each material $$$i$$$ that you currently hold.

The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i\le 10^9$$$) — the amount of each material $$$i$$$ needed to produce the artifact.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print a single line containing either "YES" or "NO", representing whether or not the artifact can be crafted.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: There are no mountains in Florida, and Florida Man cannot comprehend their existence. As such, he really needs your help with this one.

In the wilderness lies a region of mountainous terrain represented as a rectangular grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Each cell in the grid is identified by its position $$$(i, j)$$$, where $$$i$$$ is the row index and $$$j$$$ is the column index. The altitude of cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is denoted by $$$a_{i,j}$$$.

However, this region has been tampered with. A path consisting of $$$n + m - 1$$$ cells, starting from the top-left corner $$$(1, 1)$$$ and ending at the bottom-right corner $$$(n, m)$$$, has been cleared. For every cell $$$(i, j)$$$ along this path, the altitude $$$a_{i,j}$$$ has been set to $$$0$$$. The path moves strictly via downward ($$$\mathtt{D}$$$) or rightward ($$$\mathtt{R}$$$) steps.

To restore the terrain to its original state, it is known that the region possessed a magical property before it was tampered with: all rows and all columns shared the same sum of altitudes. More formally, there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$\sum_{j=1}^m a_{i, j} = x$$$ for all $$$1\le i\le n$$$, and $$$\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i, j} = x$$$ for all $$$1\le j\le m$$$.

Your task is to assign new altitudes to the cells on the path such that the above magical property is restored. It can be proven that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions that satisfy the property, any one of them may be provided.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n, m \leq 1000$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the grid.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n+m-2$$$ ($$$s_i = \mathtt{D}$$$ or $$$s_i = \mathtt{R}$$$) — the steps the path makes from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, m)$$$. The character $$$\mathtt{D}$$$ represents a downward step, and $$$\mathtt{R}$$$ represents a rightward step.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines each contain $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i, 2}, \ldots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$-10^6 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^6$$$) — the altitude of each cell in the grid. It is guaranteed that if a cell $$$(i, j)$$$ lies on the path, then $$$a_{i,j} = 0$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n$$$ lines of $$$m$$$ integers representing the restored grid of altitudes $$$b_{i, j}$$$. The altitudes must satisfy $$$-10^{15} \leq b_{i,j} \leq 10^{15}$$$, and additionally $$$a_{i,j} = b_{i,j}$$$ if $$$(i, j)$$$ is not on the path. If multiple solutions exist, output any of them.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: At his orange orchard, Florida Man receives yet another spam letter, delivered by a crow. Naturally, he's sending it back in the most inconvenient manner possible.

A crow is sitting at position $$$0$$$ of the number line. There are $$$n$$$ scarecrows positioned at integer coordinates $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ along the number line. These scarecrows have been enchanted, allowing them to move left and right at a speed of $$$1$$$ unit per second.

The crow is afraid of scarecrows and wants to stay at least a distance of $$$k$$$ ahead of the nearest scarecrow positioned at or before it. To do so, the crow uses its teleportation ability as follows:

- Let $$$x$$$ be the current position of the crow, and let $$$y$$$ be the largest position of a scarecrow such that $$$y \le x$$$. If $$$x - y < k$$$, meaning the scarecrow is too close, the crow will instantly teleport to position $$$y + k$$$.

This teleportation happens instantly and continuously. The crow will keep checking for scarecrows positioned at or to the left of him and teleport whenever one gets too close (which could happen at non-integral times). Note that besides this teleportation ability, the crow will not move on its own.

Your task is to determine the minimum time required to make the crow teleport to a position greater than or equal to $$$\ell$$$, assuming the scarecrows move optimally to allow the crow to reach its goal. For convenience, you are asked to output twice the minimum time needed for the crow to reach the target position $$$\ell$$$. It can be proven that this value will always be an integer.

Note that the scarecrows can start, stop, or change direction at any time (possibly at non-integral times).

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n, k, \ell$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq \ell \leq 10^8$$$) — the number of scarecrows, the teleportation distance, and the target position of the crow, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \leq \ell$$$) — the initial positions of the $$$n$$$ scarecrows.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer representing the twice the minimum time required for the crow to teleport to a position greater than or equal to $$$\ell$$$.

There are $$$n$$$ haystacks labelled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where haystack $$$i$$$ contains $$$a_i$$$ haybales. One of the haystacks has a needle hidden beneath it, but you do not know which one. Your task is to move the haybales so that each haystack is emptied at least once, allowing you to check if the needle is hidden under that particular haystack.

However, the process is not that simple. Once a haystack $$$i$$$ is emptied for the first time, it will be assigned a height limit and can no longer contain more than $$$b_i$$$ haybales. More formally, a move is described as follows:

- Choose two haystacks $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. If haystack $$$i$$$ has not been emptied before, or haystack $$$i$$$ contains strictly less than $$$b_i$$$ haybales, you may move exactly $$$1$$$ haybale from haystack $$$j$$$ to haystack $$$i$$$.

Note: Before a haystack is emptied, it has no height limit, and you can move as many haybales as you want onto that haystack.

Compute the minimum number of moves required to ensure that each haystack is emptied at least once, or report that it is impossible.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 5\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of haystacks.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1\le a_i, b_i\le 10^9$$$) — the initial number of haybales in the $$$i$$$-th haystack, and the height limit that it is assigned after it is emptied for the first time.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of moves required to ensure that each haystack is emptied at least once. If it is not possible to empty each haystack at least once, output -1.

A polyomino is a connected$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ figure constructed by joining one or more equal $$$1 \times 1$$$ unit squares edge to edge. A polyomino is convex if, for any two squares in the polyomino that share the same row or the same column, all squares between them are also part of the polyomino. Below are four polyominoes, only the first and second of which are convex.

You are given a convex polyomino with $$$n$$$ rows and an even area. For each row $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the unit squares from column $$$l_i$$$ to column $$$r_i$$$ are part of the polyomino. In other words, there are $$$r_i - l_i + 1$$$ unit squares that are part of the polyomino in the $$$i$$$-th row: $$$(i, l_i), (i, l_i + 1), \ldots, (i, r_i-1), (i, r_i)$$$.

Two polyominoes are congruent if and only if you can make them fit exactly on top of each other by translating the polyominoes. Note that you are not allowed to rotate or reflect the polyominoes. Determine whether it is possible to partition the given convex polyomino into two disjoint connected polyominoes that are congruent to each other. The following examples illustrate a valid partition of each of the two convex polyominoes shown above:

The partitioned polyominoes do not need to be convex, and each unit square should belong to exactly one of the two partitioned polyominoes.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rows of the polyomino.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1\le l_i\le r_i\le 10^9$$$) — the range of columns that are part of the polyomino in the $$$i$$$-th row.

It is guaranteed that the area of the polyomino is even. In other words, $$$\sum_{i=1}^n r_i - l_i + 1\equiv 0\pmod{2}$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print a single line containing either "YES" or "NO", representing whether or not the polyomino can be partitioned as described in the problem.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Iris has a tree rooted at vertex $$$1$$$. Each vertex has a value of $$$\mathtt 0$$$ or $$$\mathtt 1$$$.

Let's consider a leaf of the tree (the vertex $$$1$$$ is never considered a leaf) and define its weight. Construct a string formed by the values of the vertices on the path starting at the root and ending in this leaf. Then the weight of the leaf is the difference between the number of occurrences of $$$\mathtt{10}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{01}$$$ substrings in it.

Take the following tree as an example. Green vertices have a value of $$$\mathtt 1$$$ while white vertices have a value of $$$\mathtt 0$$$.

- Let's calculate the weight of the leaf $$$5$$$: the formed string is $$$\mathtt{10110}$$$. The number of occurrences of substring $$$\mathtt{10}$$$ is $$$2$$$, the number of occurrences of substring $$$\mathtt{01}$$$ is $$$1$$$, so the difference is $$$2 - 1 = 1$$$.
- Let's calculate the weight of the leaf $$$6$$$: the formed string is $$$\mathtt{101}$$$. The number of occurrences of substring $$$\mathtt{10}$$$ is $$$1$$$, the number of occurrences of substring $$$\mathtt{01}$$$ is $$$1$$$, so the difference is $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$.

The score of a tree is defined as the number of leaves with non-zero weight in the tree.

But the values of some vertices haven't been decided and will be given to you as $$$\texttt{?}$$$. Filling the blanks would be so boring, so Iris is going to invite Dora to play a game. On each turn, one of the girls chooses any of the remaining vertices with value $$$\texttt{?}$$$ and changes its value to $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$\mathtt{1}$$$, with Iris going first. The game continues until there are no vertices with value $$$\mathtt{?}$$$ left in the tree. Iris aims to maximize the score of the tree, while Dora aims to minimize that.

Assuming that both girls play optimally, please determine the final score of the tree.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 5\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The following $$$n - 1$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$) — denoting an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.

It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

The last line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ represents the value of vertex $$$i$$$. It's guaranteed that $$$s$$$ only contains characters $$$\mathtt{0}$$$, $$$\mathtt{1}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{?}$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the final score of the tree.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Given a rooted tree with the root at vertex $$$1$$$. For any vertex $$$i$$$ ($$$1 < i \leq n$$$) in the tree, there is an edge connecting vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i < i$$$), with a weight equal to $$$t_i$$$.

Iris does not know the values of $$$t_i$$$, but she knows that $$$\displaystyle\sum_{i=2}^n t_i = w$$$ and each of the $$$t_i$$$ is a non-negative integer.

The vertices of the tree are numbered in a special way: the numbers of the vertices in each subtree are consecutive integers. In other words, the vertices of the tree are numbered in the order of a depth-first search.

The tree in this picture satisfies the condition. For example, in the subtree of vertex $$$2$$$, the vertex numbers are $$$2, 3, 4, 5$$$, which are consecutive integers.

The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, as in the subtree of vertex $$$2$$$, the vertex numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ are not consecutive integers.

We define $$$\operatorname{dist}(u, v)$$$ as the length of the simple path between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the tree.

Next, there will be $$$n - 1$$$ events:

- Iris is given integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, indicating that $$$t_x = y$$$.

After each event, Iris wants to know the maximum possible value of $$$\operatorname{dist}(i, i \bmod n + 1)$$$ independently for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$). She only needs to know the sum of these $$$n$$$ values. Please help Iris quickly get the answers.

Note that when calculating the maximum possible values of $$$\operatorname{dist}(i, i \bmod n + 1)$$$ and $$$\operatorname{dist}(j, j \bmod n + 1)$$$ for $$$i \ne j$$$, the unknown edge weights may be different.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq w \leq 10^{12}$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the sum of the edge weights.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i < i$$$) — the description of the edges of the tree.

Then follow $$$n-1$$$ lines indicating the events. Each line contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$2 \leq x \leq n$$$, $$$0 \leq y \leq w$$$), indicating that $$$t_x = y$$$.

It is guaranteed that all $$$x$$$ in the events are distinct. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all $$$y$$$ equals $$$w$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output one line containing $$$n-1$$$ integers, each representing the answer after each event.

To expand the set to contain as many integers as possible, Eri can choose two integers $$$x\neq y$$$ from the set such that their average $$$\frac{x+y}2$$$ is still a positive integer and isn't contained in the set, and add it to the set. The integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ remain in the set.

Let's call the set of integers consecutive if, after the elements are sorted, the difference between any pair of adjacent elements is $$$1$$$. For example, sets $$$\{2\}$$$, $$$\{2, 5, 4, 3\}$$$, $$$\{5, 6, 8, 7\}$$$ are consecutive, while $$$\{2, 4, 5, 6\}$$$, $$$\{9, 7\}$$$ are not.

However, since her brain is unable to withstand too complex calculations, she could not multiply two integers with the product greater than $$$k$$$ together. Otherwise, her brain may explode!

Her teacher sets a difficult task every day as her daily summer holiday homework. Now she is given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ elements, and she needs to calculate the product of each two adjacent elements (that is, $$$a_1 \cdot a_2$$$, $$$a_2 \cdot a_3$$$, and so on). Iris wants her brain to work safely, and in order to do that, she would like to modify the array $$$a$$$ in such a way that $$$a_i \cdot a_{i + 1} \leq k$$$ holds for every $$$1 \leq i < n$$$. There are two types of operations she can perform:

1. She can rearrange the elements of the array $$$a$$$ in an arbitrary way.
2. She can select an arbitrary element of the array $$$a$$$ and change its value to an arbitrary integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$.

Iris wants to minimize the number of operations of type $$$2$$$ that she uses.

However, that's completely not the end of the summer holiday! Summer holiday lasts for $$$q$$$ days, and on the $$$i$$$-th day, Iris is asked to solve the Math homework for the subarray $$$b_{l_i}, b_{l_i + 1}, \ldots, b_{r_i}$$$. Help Iris and tell her the minimum number of type $$$2$$$ operations she needs to perform for each day. Note that the operations are independent for each day, i.e. the array $$$b$$$ is not changed.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 5\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq q \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq 10^6$$$) — the length of array $$$b$$$, the number of days, and the upper bound for the multiplication calculation.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i \leq k$$$) — the elements of the array $$$b$$$.

Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq n$$$) — the boundaries of the subarray on the $$$i$$$-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test, output a single line containing $$$q$$$ integers — the minimum number of operations of type $$$2$$$ needed for each day.

Let's define the depth of a rooted tree as the maximum number of vertices on the simple paths from some vertex to the root. A full binary tree of depth $$$d$$$ is a binary tree of depth $$$d$$$ with exactly $$$2^d - 1$$$ vertices.

Iris calls a tree a $$$d$$$-binary tree if some vertices and edges can be added to it to make it a full binary tree of depth $$$d$$$. Note that any vertex can be chosen as the root of a full binary tree.

Since performing operations on large trees is difficult, she defines the binary depth of a tree as the minimum $$$d$$$ satisfying that the tree is $$$d$$$-binary. Specifically, if there is no integer $$$d \ge 1$$$ such that the tree is $$$d$$$-binary, the binary depth of the tree is $$$-1$$$.

Iris now has a tree consisting of only vertex $$$1$$$. She wants to add $$$n - 1$$$ more vertices to form a larger tree. She will add the vertices one by one. When she adds vertex $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \leq i \leq n$$$), she'll give you an integer $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i < i$$$), and add a new edge connecting vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$.

Iris wants to ask you the binary depth of the tree formed by the first $$$i$$$ vertices for each $$$1 \le i \le n$$$. Can you tell her the answer?

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the final size of the tree.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i < i$$$) — descriptions of all edges of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case output $$$n$$$ integers, $$$i$$$-th of them representing the binary depth of the tree formed by the first $$$i$$$ vertices.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Sadly, Dora poured the paint when painting the class mural. Dora considers the mural as the matrix $$$b$$$ of size $$$n \times n$$$. Initially, $$$b_{i,j} = 0$$$ for all $$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$.

Dora has only two brushes which have two different colors. In one operation, she can paint the matrix with one of two brushes:

- The first brush has color $$$1$$$ on it and can paint one column of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $$$1 \leq j \leq n$$$ and makes $$$b_{i,j} := 1$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$;
- The second brush has color $$$2$$$ on it and can paint one row of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ and makes $$$b_{i,j} := 2$$$ for all $$$1 \leq j \leq n$$$.

Dora paints the matrix so that the resulting matrix $$$b$$$ contains only $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$.

For a matrix $$$b$$$, let $$$f(b)$$$ denote the minimum number of operations needed to turn the initial matrix (containing only $$$0$$$) into $$$b$$$. The beauty of a matrix $$$b$$$ is the number of ways to paint the initial matrix in exactly $$$f(b)$$$ operations to turn it into $$$b$$$. If there's no way to turn the initial matrix into $$$b$$$, the beauty of $$$b$$$ is $$$0$$$.

However, Dora made a uniformly random mistake; there's exactly one element different in the matrix $$$a$$$ given to you from the real matrix $$$b$$$. That is, there is exactly one pair $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$a_{i, j} = 3 - b_{i, j}$$$.

Please help Dora compute the expected beauty of the real matrix $$$b$$$ modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$ (all possible $$$n^2$$$ mistakes have equal probability).

Since the size of the matrix is too large, Dora will only tell you the positions of $$$m$$$ elements of color $$$1$$$, and the remaining $$$n^2-m$$$ elements have color $$$2$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq m \leq \min(10^6, n^2)$$$) — the size of the matrix and the number of elements of color $$$1$$$.

Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each containing two positive integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n$$$) — denoting that $$$a_{x_i, y_i} = 1$$$.

It is guaranteed that if $$$i \neq j$$$, then $$$(x_i, y_i) \neq (x_j, y_j)$$$.

It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\cdot10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the expected beauty of the real matrix $$$b$$$, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Mualani loves surfing on her sharky surfboard!

Mualani's surf path can be modeled by a number line. She starts at position $$$1$$$, and the path ends at position $$$L$$$. When she is at position $$$x$$$ with a jump power of $$$k$$$, she can jump to any integer position in the interval $$$[x, x+k]$$$. Initially, her jump power is $$$1$$$.

However, her surf path isn't completely smooth. There are $$$n$$$ hurdles on her path. Each hurdle is represented by an interval $$$[l, r]$$$, meaning she cannot jump to any position in the interval $$$[l, r]$$$.

There are also $$$m$$$ power-ups at certain positions on the path. Power-up $$$i$$$ is located at position $$$x_i$$$ and has a value of $$$v_i$$$. When Mualani is at position $$$x_i$$$, she has the option to collect the power-up to increase her jump power by $$$v_i$$$. There may be multiple power-ups at the same position. When she is at a position with some power-ups, she may choose to take or ignore each individual power-up. No power-up is in the interval of any hurdle.

What is the minimum number of power-ups she must collect to reach position $$$L$$$ to finish the path? If it is not possible to finish the surf path, output $$$-1$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$L$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5, 3 \leq L \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of hurdles, the number of power-ups, and the position of the end.

The following $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$2 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq L-1$$$) — the bounds of the interval for the $$$i$$$'th hurdle. It is guaranteed that $$$r_i + 1 < l_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i < n$$$ (i.e. all hurdles are non-overlapping, sorted by increasing positions, and the end point of a previous hurdle is not consecutive with the start point of the next hurdle).

The following $$$m$$$ lines contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_i, v_i \leq L$$$) — the position and the value for the $$$i$$$'th power-up. There may be multiple power-ups with the same $$$x$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$x_i \leq x_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i < m$$$ (i.e. the power-ups are sorted by non-decreasing position) and no power-up is in the interval of any hurdle.

It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the minimum number of power-ups she must collect to reach position $$$L$$$. If it is not possible, output $$$-1$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is an interactive problem.

Kachina challenges you to guess her favorite binary string$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. She defines $$$f(l, r)$$$ as the number of subsequences$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of $$$\texttt{01}$$$ in $$$s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r$$$. Two subsequences are considered different if they are formed by deleting characters from different positions in the original string, even if the resulting subsequences consist of the same characters.

To determine $$$s$$$, you can ask her some questions. In each question, you can choose two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l < r \leq n$$$) and ask her for the value of $$$f(l, r)$$$.

Determine and output $$$s$$$ after asking Kachina no more than $$$n$$$ questions. However, it may be the case that $$$s$$$ is impossible to be determined. In this case, you would need to report $$$\texttt{IMPOSSIBLE}$$$ instead.

Formally, $$$s$$$ is impossible to be determined if after asking $$$n$$$ questions, there are always multiple possible strings for $$$s$$$, regardless of what questions are asked. Note that if you report $$$\texttt{IMPOSSIBLE}$$$ when there exists a sequence of at most $$$n$$$ queries that will uniquely determine the binary string, you will get the Wrong Answer verdict.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^4$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You have obtained the new limited event character Xilonen. You decide to use her in combat.

There are $$$n$$$ enemies in a line. The $$$i$$$'th enemy from the left has health $$$h_i$$$ and is currently at position $$$x_i$$$. Xilonen has an attack damage of $$$m$$$, and you are ready to defeat the enemies with her.

Xilonen has a powerful "ground stomp" attack. Before you perform any attacks, you select an integer $$$p$$$ and position Xilonen there ($$$p$$$ can be any integer position, including a position with an enemy currently). Afterwards, for each attack, she deals $$$m$$$ damage to an enemy at position $$$p$$$ (if there are any), $$$m-1$$$ damage to enemies at positions $$$p-1$$$ and $$$p+1$$$, $$$m-2$$$ damage to enemies at positions $$$p-2$$$ and $$$p+2$$$, and so on. Enemies that are at least a distance of $$$m$$$ away from Xilonen take no damage from attacks.

Formally, if there is an enemy at position $$$x$$$, she will deal $$$\max(0,m - |p - x|)$$$ damage to that enemy each hit. Note that you may not choose a different $$$p$$$ for different attacks.

Over all possible $$$p$$$, output the minimum number of attacks Xilonen must perform to defeat at least $$$k$$$ enemies. If it is impossible to find a $$$p$$$ such that eventually at least $$$k$$$ enemies will be defeated, output $$$-1$$$ instead. Note that an enemy is considered to be defeated if its health reaches $$$0$$$ or below.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) – the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq m \leq 10^9$$$).

The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, ..., h_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq h_i \leq 10^9$$$).

The last line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$$$ ($$$1\leq x_i \leq 10^9$$$, $$$x_i < x_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i < n$$$)

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output an integer on a new line, the minimum number of attacks that must be performed to defeat at least $$$k$$$ enemies. If it is impossible to find a $$$p$$$ such that eventually at least $$$k$$$ enemies will be defeated, output $$$-1$$$ instead.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Kevin enjoys logic puzzles.

He played a game with $$$n$$$ classmates who stand in a line. The $$$i$$$-th person from the left says that there are $$$a_i$$$ liars to their left (not including themselves).

Each classmate is either honest or a liar, with the restriction that no two liars can stand next to each other. Honest classmates always say the truth. Liars can say either the truth or lies, meaning their statements are considered unreliable.

Kevin wants to determine the number of distinct possible game configurations modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$. Two configurations are considered different if at least one classmate is honest in one configuration and a liar in the other.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of classmates.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the number of liars to the left of the $$$i$$$-th person they claimed.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output one integer — the number of distinct game configurations modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Kevin wrote an integer sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ on the blackboard.

Kevin can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Select two integers $$$x, y$$$ on the blackboard such that $$$|x - y| \leq 1$$$, erase them, and then write down an integer $$$x + y$$$ instead.

Kevin wants to know if it is possible to transform these integers into an integer sequence $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ through some sequence of operations.

Two sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are considered the same if and only if their multisets are identical. In other words, for any number $$$x$$$, the number of times it appears in $$$a$$$ must be equal to the number of times it appears in $$$b$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\leq m \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and the length of $$$b$$$.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).

The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1\leq b_i \leq 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output "Yes" if it is possible to transform $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$, and "No" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, string $$$t$$$ consists of only '0' and '1'. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Kevin has a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Kevin can perform the following operation:

- Choose two adjacent blocks of $$$s$$$ and swap them.

A block is a maximal substring$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of identical characters. Formally, denote $$$s[l,r]$$$ as the substring $$$s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r$$$. A block is $$$s[l,r]$$$ satisfying:

- $$$l=1$$$ or $$$s_l\not=s_{l-1}$$$.
- $$$s_l=s_{l+1} = \ldots = s_{r}$$$.
- $$$r=n$$$ or $$$s_r\not=s_{r+1}$$$.

Adjacent blocks are two blocks $$$s[l_1,r_1]$$$ and $$$s[l_2,r_2]$$$ satisfying $$$r_1+1=l_2$$$.

For example, if $$$s=\mathtt{000}\,\mathbf{11}\,\mathbf{00}\,\mathtt{111}$$$, Kevin can choose the two blocks $$$s[4,5]$$$ and $$$s[6,7]$$$ and swap them, transforming $$$s$$$ into $$$\mathtt{000}\,\mathbf{00}\,\mathbf{11}\,\mathtt{111}$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is an interactive problem.

Kevin has $$$n$$$ classmates, numbered $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$. Any two of them may either be friends or not friends.

Kevin wants to select $$$2k$$$ classmates to form $$$k$$$ teams, where each team contains exactly $$$2$$$ people. Each person can belong to at most one team.

Let $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ be two people in the $$$i$$$-th team. To avoid potential conflicts during team formation, the team members must satisfy one of the following two conditions:

- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\leq i \leq k$$$), classmate $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ are friends.
- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\leq i \leq k$$$), classmate $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ are not friends.

Kevin wants to determine the maximum $$$k$$$ such that, regardless of the friendship relationships among the $$$n$$$ people, he can always find $$$2k$$$ people to form the teams. After that, he needs to form $$$k$$$ teams. But asking whether two classmates are friends is awkward, so Kevin wants to achieve this while asking about the friendship status of no more than $$$n$$$ pairs of classmates.

The interactor is adaptive. It means that the hidden relationship between classmates is not fixed before the interaction and will change during the interaction.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you only need to determine whether a valid sequence of operations exists. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Kevin has an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. Initially, some vertices contain stones, which Kevin wants to move to new positions.

Kevin can perform the following operation:

- For each stone at $$$u_i$$$, select a neighboring vertex $$$v_i$$$. Simultaneously move each stone from $$$u_i$$$ to its corresponding $$$v_i$$$.

At any time, each vertex can contain at most one stone.

Determine whether a valid sequence of operations exists that moves the stones from the initial state to the target state.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\leq n \leq 2000$$$, $$$0\leq m \leq \min(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 10^4)$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.

The second line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ consisting of '0' and '1'. The $$$i$$$-th bit of $$$s$$$ indicates the number of stones on the $$$i$$$-th vertex in the initial state.

The third line contains a binary string $$$t$$$ consisting of '0' and '1'. The $$$i$$$-th bit of $$$t$$$ indicates the number of stones on the $$$i$$$-th vertex in the target state.

Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1\leq u, v \leq n$$$) — an undirected edge between the $$$u$$$-th vertex and the $$$v$$$-th vertex.

It is guaranteed that the graph is simple. There are no self-loops and parallel edges in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the numbers of '1' in $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ are the same.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

For each test case, on the first line, output "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether a valid sequence of operations exists.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

Output a valid sequence of operations with no more than $$$2n$$$ moves if one exists. It can be proven that if a valid sequence exists, a valid sequence with no more than $$$2n$$$ moves exists.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

If a valid sequence of operations exists, output a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \leq k \leq 2n$$$) on the second line, representing the number of operations. Suppose there are $$$c$$$ stones in the initial state. The next $$$k + 1$$$ lines should each contain distinct $$$c$$$ integers, representing the positions of the stones before the operations and after each operation. These positions should satisfy the following:

- The positions of the stones in the first line match the initial state from the input, in any order.
- The positions of the stones in the last line match the target state from the input, in any order.
- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\leq i\leq k$$$) and $$$j$$$ ($$$1\leq j\leq c$$$), ensure that the $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line and the $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$(i+1)$$$-th line correspond to adjacent vertices in the graph. In other words, the stone is moved from its previous position to the next.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

- Type 1: Kevin needs to spend $$$a_i$$$ time to defeat Nivek and win the match. If Kevin doesn't spend $$$a_i$$$ time on it, Nivek will win the match.
- Type 2: The outcome of this match depends on their historical records. If Kevin's number of wins is greater than or equal to Nivek's up to this match, then Kevin wins. Otherwise, Nivek wins.

Kevin wants to know the minimum amount of time he needs to spend to ensure he wins at least $$$k$$$ matches.

Output the answers for $$$k = 0, 1, \ldots, n$$$.

Input and Output Format:

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of matches.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).

If $$$a_i = -1$$$, the $$$i$$$-th match is of Type 2. Otherwise, the $$$i$$$-th match is of Type 1, and $$$a_i$$$ represents the amount of time Kevin needs to spend to win this match.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In one operation, you can pick an index $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ inclusive, and do one of the following actions:

- Decrease $$$a_{i-1}$$$ by $$$1$$$, then increase $$$a_{i+1}$$$ by $$$1$$$.
- Decrease $$$a_{i+1}$$$ by $$$1$$$, then increase $$$a_{i-1}$$$ by $$$1$$$.

After each operation, all the values must be non-negative. Can you make all the elements equal after any number of operations?

Input and Output Format:
First line of input consists of one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.

First line of each test case consists of one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$).

Second line of each test case consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ of all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print "YES" without quotation marks if it is possible to make all the elements equal after any number of operations; otherwise, print "NO" without quotation marks.

You can print answers in any register: "yes", "YeS", "nO"  — will also be considered correct.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given a number $$$n$$$ with a length of no more than $$$10^5$$$.

You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose one of its digits, square it, and replace the original digit with the result. The result must be a digit (that is, if you choose the digit $$$x$$$, then the value of $$$x^2$$$ must be less than $$$10$$$).

Is it possible to obtain a number that is divisible by $$$9$$$ through these operations?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains the number $$$n$$$, without leading zeros. The length of the number does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the numbers across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to obtain a number divisible by $$$9$$$ using the described operations, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given three strings: $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The string $$$c$$$ was obtained in the following way:

1. At each step, either string $$$a$$$ or string $$$b$$$ was randomly chosen, and the first character of the chosen string was removed from it and appended to the end of string $$$c$$$, until one of the strings ran out. After that, the remaining characters of the non-empty string were added to the end of $$$c$$$.
2. Then, a certain number of characters in string $$$c$$$ were randomly changed.

For example, from the strings $$$a=\color{red}{\text{abra}}$$$ and $$$b=\color{blue}{\text{cada}}$$$, without character replacements, the strings $$$\color{blue}{\text{ca}}\color{red}{\text{ab}}\color{blue}{\text{d}}\color{red}{\text{ra}}\color{blue}{\text{a}}$$$, $$$\color{red}{\text{abra}}\color{blue}{\text{cada}}$$$, $$$\color{red}{\text{a}}\color{blue}{\text{cada}}\color{red}{\text{bra}}$$$ could be obtained.

Find the minimum number of characters that could have been changed in string $$$c$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one string of lowercase Latin letters $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \leq |a| \leq 10^3$$$) — the first string, where $$$|a|$$$ denotes the length of string $$$a$$$.

The second line of each test case contains one string of lowercase Latin letters $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \leq |b| \leq 10^3$$$) — the second string, where $$$|b|$$$ denotes the length of string $$$b$$$.

The third line of each test case contains one string of lowercase Latin letters $$$c$$$ ($$$|c| = |a| + |b|$$$) — the third string.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|a|$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^3$$$. Also, the sum of $$$|b|$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^3$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters that could have been changed in string $$$c$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Alice has just crafted a circuit with $$$n$$$ lights and $$$2n$$$ switches. Each component (a light or a switch) has two states: on or off. The lights and switches are arranged in a way that:

- Each light is connected to exactly two switches.
- Each switch is connected to exactly one light. It's unknown which light each switch is connected to.
- When all switches are off, all lights are also off.
- If a switch is toggled (from on to off, or vice versa), the state of the light connected to it will also toggle.

Alice brings the circuit, which shows only the states of the $$$2n$$$ switches, to her sister Iris and gives her a riddle: what is the minimum and maximum number of lights that can be turned on?

Knowing her little sister's antics too well, Iris takes no more than a second to give Alice a correct answer. Can you do the same?

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 50$$$) — the number of lights in the circuit.

The second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 1$$$) — the states of the switches in the circuit. $$$a_i = 0$$$ means the $$$i$$$-th switch is off, and $$$a_i = 1$$$ means the $$$i$$$-th switch is on.

For each test case, output two integers — the minimum and maximum number of lights, respectively, that can be turned on.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an array $$$a = [1, 2, \ldots, n]$$$, where $$$n$$$ is odd, and an integer $$$k$$$.

Your task is to choose an odd positive integer $$$m$$$ and to split $$$a$$$ into $$$m$$$ subarrays$$$^{\dagger}$$$ $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ such that:

- Each element of the array $$$a$$$ belongs to exactly one subarray.
- For all $$$1 \le i \le m$$$, $$$|b_i|$$$ is odd, i.e., the length of each subarray is odd.
- $$$\operatorname{median}([\operatorname{median}(b_1), \operatorname{median}(b_2), \ldots, \operatorname{median}(b_m)]) = k$$$, i.e., the median$$$^{\ddagger}$$$ of the array of medians of all subarrays must equal $$$k$$$. $$$\operatorname{median}(c)$$$ denotes the median of the array $$$c$$$.

$$$^{\dagger}$$$A subarray of the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is the array $$$[a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r]$$$ for some integers $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$.

$$$^{\ddagger}$$$A median of the array of odd length is the middle element after the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. For example: $$$\operatorname{median}([1,2,5,4,3]) = 3$$$, $$$\operatorname{median}([3,2,1]) = 2$$$, $$$\operatorname{median}([2,1,2,1,2,2,2]) = 2$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n < 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n$$$ is odd) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and the desired median of the array of medians of all subarrays.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case:

- If there is no suitable partition, output $$$-1$$$ in a single line.
- Otherwise, in the first line, output an odd integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le n$$$), and in the second line, output $$$m$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2 , p_3 , \ldots, p_m$$$ ($$$1 = p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < \ldots < p_m \le n$$$) — denoting the left borders of each subarray.

In detail, for a valid answer $$$[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m]$$$:

- $$$b_1 = \left[ a_{p_1}, a_{p_1 + 1}, \ldots, a_{p_2 - 1} \right]$$$
- $$$b_2 = \left[ a_{p_2}, a_{p_2 + 1}, \ldots, a_{p_3 - 1} \right]$$$
- $$$\ldots$$$

Upon clearing the Waterside Area, Gretel has found a monster named Genokraken, and she's keeping it contained for her scientific studies.

The monster's nerve system can be structured as a tree$$$^{\dagger}$$$ of $$$n$$$ nodes (really, everything should stop resembling trees all the time$$$\ldots$$$), numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$, with node $$$0$$$ as the root.

Gretel's objective is to learn the exact structure of the monster's nerve system — more specifically, she wants to know the values $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{n-1}$$$ of the tree, where $$$p_i$$$ ($$$0 \le p_i < i$$$) is the direct parent node of node $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n - 1$$$).

She doesn't know exactly how the nodes are placed, but she knows a few convenient facts:

- If we remove root node $$$0$$$ and all adjacent edges, this tree will turn into a forest consisting of only paths$$$^{\ddagger}$$$. Each node that was initially adjacent to the node $$$0$$$ will be the end of some path.
- The nodes are indexed in a way that if $$$1 \le x \le y \le n - 1$$$, then $$$p_x \le p_y$$$.
- Node $$$1$$$ has exactly two adjacent nodes (including the node $$$0$$$).

The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because if we remove node $$$0$$$, then node $$$2$$$ (which was initially adjacent to the node $$$0$$$) will not be the end of the path $$$4-2-5$$$.The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because $$$p_3 \le p_4$$$ must hold.The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because node $$$1$$$ has only one adjacent node.

Gretel can make queries to the containment cell:

- "? a b" ($$$1 \le a, b < n$$$, $$$a \ne b$$$) — the cell will check if the simple path between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ contains the node $$$0$$$.

However, to avoid unexpected consequences by overstimulating the creature, Gretel wants to query at most $$$2n - 6$$$ times. Though Gretel is gifted, she can't do everything all at once, so can you give her a helping hand?

$$$^{\dagger}$$$A tree is a connected graph where every pair of distinct nodes has exactly one simple path connecting them.

$$$^{\ddagger}$$$A path is a tree whose vertices can be listed in the order $$$v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$$$ such that the edges are $$$(v_i, v_{i+1})$$$ ($$$1 \le i < k$$$).

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \le n \le 10^4$$$) — the number of nodes in Genokraken's nerve system.

Eventually, he has obtained $$$n$$$ pockets of peanuts, conveniently numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. The $$$i$$$-th pocket has $$$a_i$$$ peanuts.

Jack and his childhood friend Alice decide to play a game around the peanuts. First, Alice divides the pockets into some boxes; each box will have a non-zero number of consecutive pockets, and each pocket will, obviously, belong to exactly one box. At the same time, Alice does not change the order of the boxes, that is, the boxes are numbered in ascending order of the indices of the pockets in them.

After that, Alice and Jack will take turns alternately, with Alice going first.

At each turn, the current player will remove a positive number of peanuts from exactly one pocket which belongs to the leftmost non-empty box (i.e., the leftmost box containing at least one non-empty pocket). In other words, if we number the boxes from left to right, then each player can only pick peanuts from the pocket in the $$$j$$$-th box ($$$j \ge 2$$$) only if the $$$(j - 1)$$$-th box has no peanuts left. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

Alice is sure she will win since she has the advantage of dividing the pockets into boxes herself. Thus, she wanted to know how many ways there are for her to divide the peanuts into boxes at the start of the game so that she will win, assuming both players play optimally. Can you help her with the calculation?

As the result can be very large, output it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$) — the number of pockets.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of peanuts in each pocket.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of ways for Alice to divide the pockets into boxes at the start of the game to guarantee her win, assuming both players play optimally, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

They are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, and Turtle goes first. Turtle and Piggy alternate in turns (so, Turtle does the first turn, Piggy does the second, Turtle does the third, etc.).

The game goes as follows:

- Let the current length of the sequence be $$$m$$$. If $$$m = 1$$$, the game ends.
- If the game does not end and it's Turtle's turn, then Turtle must choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le m - 1$$$, set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$\max(a_i, a_{i + 1})$$$, and remove $$$a_{i + 1}$$$.
- If the game does not end and it's Piggy's turn, then Piggy must choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le m - 1$$$, set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$\min(a_i, a_{i + 1})$$$, and remove $$$a_{i + 1}$$$.

Turtle wants to maximize the value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end, while Piggy wants to minimize the value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end. Find the value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end if both players play optimally.

You can refer to notes for further clarification.

One day, Turtle was playing with $$$n$$$ sequences. Let the length of the $$$i$$$-th sequence be $$$l_i$$$. Then the $$$i$$$-th sequence was $$$a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \ldots, a_{i, l_i}$$$.

Piggy gave Turtle a problem to solve when Turtle was playing. The statement of the problem was:

- There was a non-negative integer $$$x$$$ at first. Turtle would perform an arbitrary number (possibly zero) of operations on the integer.
- In each operation, Turtle could choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le n$$$, and set $$$x$$$ to $$$\text{mex}^{\dagger}(x, a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \ldots, a_{i, l_i})$$$.
- Turtle was asked to find the answer, which was the maximum value of $$$x$$$ after performing an arbitrary number of operations.

Turtle solved the above problem without difficulty. He defined $$$f(k)$$$ as the answer to the above problem when the initial value of $$$x$$$ was $$$k$$$.

Then Piggy gave Turtle a non-negative integer $$$m$$$ and asked Turtle to find the value of $$$\sum\limits_{i = 0}^m f(i)$$$ (i.e., the value of $$$f(0) + f(1) + \ldots + f(m)$$$). Unfortunately, he couldn't solve this problem. Please help him!

$$$^{\dagger}\text{mex}(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k)$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the sequence $$$c$$$. For example, $$$\text{mex}(2, 2, 0, 3)$$$ is $$$1$$$, $$$\text{mex}(1, 2)$$$ is $$$0$$$.

Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains several integers.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$\sum l_i$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is an easy version of this problem. The differences between the versions are the constraint on $$$m$$$ and $$$r_i < l_{i + 1}$$$ holds for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m - 1$$$ in the easy version. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Turtle gives you $$$m$$$ intervals $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \ldots, [l_m, r_m]$$$. He thinks that a permutation $$$p$$$ is interesting if there exists an integer $$$k_i$$$ for every interval ($$$l_i \le k_i < r_i$$$), and if he lets $$$a_i = \max\limits_{j = l_i}^{k_i} p_j, b_i = \min\limits_{j = k_i + 1}^{r_i} p_j$$$ for every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, the following condition holds:

$$$$$$\max\limits_{i = 1}^m a_i < \min\limits_{i = 1}^m b_i$$$$$$

Turtle wants you to calculate the maximum number of inversions of all interesting permutations of length $$$n$$$, or tell him if there is no interesting permutation.

An inversion of a permutation $$$p$$$ is a pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$) such that $$$p_i > p_j$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^3, 0 \le m \le \frac{n}{2}$$$) — the length of the permutation and the number of intervals.

The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i < r_i \le n$$$) — the $$$i$$$-th interval.

Additional constraint on the input in this version: $$$r_i < l_{i + 1}$$$ holds for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m - 1$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^3$$$.

For each test case, if there is no interesting permutation, output a single integer $$$-1$$$.

Otherwise, output a single integer — the maximum number of inversions.

Turtle will choose a subsequence of $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$ of length $$$m$$$, let it be $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$$$. The subsequence should satisfy the following conditions:

- $$$a_{p_1} \le a_{p_2} \le \cdots \le a_{p_m}$$$;
- All $$$b_{p_i}$$$ for all indices $$$i$$$ are pairwise distinct, i.e., there don't exist two different indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ such that $$$b_{p_i} = b_{p_j}$$$.

Help him find the maximum value of $$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}$$$, or tell him that it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $$$m$$$ that satisfies the conditions above.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Kevin is trapped in Lakeside Village by Grace. At the exit of the village, there is a combination lock that can only be unlocked if Kevin solves it.

The combination lock starts with an integer $$$ x $$$. Kevin can perform one of the following two operations zero or more times:

1. If $$$ x \neq 33 $$$, he can select two consecutive digits $$$ 3 $$$ from $$$ x $$$ and remove them simultaneously. For example, if $$$ x = 13\,323 $$$, he can remove the second and third $$$ 3 $$$, changing $$$ x $$$ to $$$ 123 $$$.
2. If $$$ x \geq 33 $$$, he can change $$$ x $$$ to $$$ x - 33 $$$. For example, if $$$ x = 99 $$$, he can choose this operation to change $$$ x $$$ to $$$ 99 - 33 = 66 $$$.

When the value of $$$ x $$$ on the combination lock becomes $$$ 0 $$$, Kevin can unlock the lock and escape from Lakeside Village. Please determine whether it is possible for Kevin to unlock the combination lock and escape.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$).

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Kevin used to get into Rio's Memories, and in Rio's Memories, a series of contests was once held. Kevin remembers all the participants and all the contest problems from that time, but he has forgotten the specific rounds, the distribution of problems, and the exact rankings.

There are $$$ m $$$ problems in total, with the $$$ i $$$-th problem having a difficulty of $$$ b_i $$$. Let each contest consist of $$$ k $$$ problems, resulting in a total of $$$ \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor $$$ contests. This means that you select exactly $$$ \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor \cdot k $$$ problems for the contests in any combination you want, with each problem being selected at most once, and the remaining $$$m\bmod k$$$ problems are left unused. For example, if $$$m = 17$$$ and $$$k = 3$$$, you should create exactly $$$5$$$ contests consisting of $$$3$$$ problems each, and exactly $$$2$$$ problems will be left unused.

There are $$$ n $$$ participants in the contests, with Kevin being the $$$1$$$-st participant. The $$$ i $$$-th participant has a rating of $$$ a_i $$$. During the contests, each participant solves all problems with a difficulty not exceeding their rating, meaning the $$$ i $$$-th participant solves the $$$ j $$$-th problem if and only if $$$ a_i \geq b_j $$$. In each contest, Kevin's rank is one plus the number of participants who solve more problems than he does.

For each $$$ k = 1, 2, \ldots, m $$$, Kevin wants to know the minimum sum of his ranks across all $$$ \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor $$$ contests. In other words, for some value of $$$k$$$, after selecting the problems for each contest, you calculate the rank of Kevin in each contest and sum up these ranks over all $$$ \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor $$$ contests. Your goal is to minimize this value.

Note that contests for different values of $$$k$$$ are independent. It means that for different values of $$$k$$$, you can select the distribution of problems into the contests independently.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$ t $$$ ($$$ 1 \le t \le 5\cdot 10^4 $$$).

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$ n $$$ and $$$ m $$$ ($$$ 1 \le n, m \leq 3\cdot 10^5 $$$) — the number of participants and the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains $$$ n $$$ integers $$$ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $$$ ($$$ 0 \le a_i \le 10^9 $$$) — the rating of each participant.

The third line of each test case contains $$$ m $$$ integers $$$ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m $$$ ($$$ 0 \le b_i \le 10^9 $$$) — the difficulty of each problem.

It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$ n $$$ and the sum of $$$ m $$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$ 3 \cdot 10^5 $$$.

For each test case, output $$$m$$$ integers — the minimum sum of Kevin's ranks for each $$$ k = 1, 2, \ldots, m$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: The Arms Factory needs a poster design pattern and finds Kevin for help.

A poster design pattern is a bipartite graph with $$$ 2n $$$ vertices in the left part and $$$ m $$$ vertices in the right part, where there is an edge between each vertex in the left part and each vertex in the right part, resulting in a total of $$$ 2nm $$$ edges.

Kevin must color each edge with a positive integer in the range $$$ [1, n] $$$. A poster design pattern is good if there are no monochromatic cycles$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ in the bipartite graph.

Kevin needs your assistance in constructing a good bipartite graph or informing him if it is impossible.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$ t $$$ ($$$ 1 \le t \le 100 $$$).

The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$ n $$$ and $$$ m $$$ ($$$ 1 \le n, m \leq 10^3 $$$) — the bipartite graph has $$$ 2n $$$ vertices in the left part and $$$ m $$$ vertices in the right part.

It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$ n $$$ and the sum of $$$ m $$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$ 10^3 $$$.

For each test case, if there is no solution, then output No.

Otherwise, output Yes, and then output $$$ 2n $$$ lines, with each line containing $$$ m $$$ positive integers. The $$$ i $$$-th line's $$$ j $$$-th integer represents the color of the edge between the $$$ i $$$-th vertex in the left part and the $$$ j $$$-th vertex in the right part.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will be recognized as a positive answer).

On the board, there are two rows of positive integers written, each containing $$$ n $$$ numbers. The first row is $$$ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $$$, and the second row is $$$ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n $$$.

For each division exercise, Kevin can choose any segment $$$ [l, r] $$$ and find the smallest value $$$ x $$$ among $$$ b_l, b_{l+1}, \ldots, b_r $$$. He will then modify each $$$ a_i $$$ for $$$ l \leq i \leq r $$$ to be the ceiling of $$$ a_i $$$ divided by $$$ x $$$.

Formally, he selects two integers $$$ 1 \leq l \leq r \leq n $$$, sets $$$ x = \min_{l \leq i \leq r} b_i $$$, and changes all $$$ a_i $$$ for $$$ l \leq i \leq r $$$ to $$$ \lceil \frac{a_i}{x} \rceil $$$.

Kevin can leave class and go home when all $$$ a_i $$$ become $$$ 1 $$$. He is eager to leave and wants to know the minimum number of division exercises required to achieve this.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$ t $$$ ($$$ 1 \le t \le 10^4 $$$).

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$ n $$$ ($$$ 1 \le n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 $$$) — the length of the sequence $$$ a $$$ and $$$ b $$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$ n $$$ integers $$$ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $$$ ($$$ 1 \le a_i \le 10^{18} $$$) — the first row of integers on the board.

The third line of each test case contains $$$ n $$$ integers $$$ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n $$$ ($$$ 2 \le b_i \le 10^{18} $$$) — the second row of integers on the board.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$ n $$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$ 2 \cdot 10^5 $$$.

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of division exercises required to leave class.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Kevin is exploring problems related to binary strings in Chinatown. When he was at a loss, a stranger approached him and introduced a peculiar operation:

- Suppose the current binary string is $$$ t $$$, with a length of $$$ \vert t \vert $$$. Choose an integer $$$ 1 \leq p \leq \vert t \vert $$$. For all $$$ 1 \leq i < p $$$, simultaneously perform the operation $$$ t_i = \max(t_i, t_{i+1}) $$$, and then delete $$$ t_p $$$.

For example, suppose the current binary string is 01001, and you choose $$$ p = 4 $$$. Perform $$$ t_i = \max(t_i, t_{i+1}) $$$ for $$$t_1$$$, $$$t_2$$$, and $$$ t_3 $$$, transforming the string into 11001, then delete $$$ t_4 $$$, resulting in 1101.

Kevin finds this strange operation quite interesting. Thus, he wants to ask you: Given a binary string $$$ s $$$, how many distinct non-empty binary strings can you obtain through any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Since the answer may be very large, you only need to output the result modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Skibidus lands on a foreign planet, where the local Amog tribe speaks the Amog'u language. In Amog'u, there are two forms of nouns, which are singular and plural.

Given that the root of the noun is transcribed as $$$S$$$, the two forms are transcribed as:

- Singular: $$$S$$$ $$$+$$$ "us"
- Plural: $$$S$$$ $$$+$$$ "i"

Here, $$$+$$$ denotes string concatenation. For example, abc $$$+$$$ def $$$=$$$ abcdef.

For example, when $$$S$$$ is transcribed as "amog", then the singular form is transcribed as "amogus", and the plural form is transcribed as "amogi". Do note that Amog'u nouns can have an empty root — in specific, "us" is the singular form of "i" (which, on an unrelated note, means "imposter" and "imposters" respectively).

Given a transcribed Amog'u noun in singular form, please convert it to the transcription of the corresponding plural noun.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a string $$$W$$$, which is a transcribed Amog'u noun in singular form. It is guaranteed that $$$W$$$ consists of only lowercase English letters, has a length of at most $$$10$$$, and ends with "us".

For each test case, output the transcription of the corresponding plural noun on a separate line.

Skibidus has obtained two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, containing $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ elements respectively. For each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, he is allowed to perform the operation at most once:

- Choose an integer $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \leq j \leq m$$$. Set $$$a_i := b_j - a_i$$$. Note that $$$a_i$$$ may become non-positive as a result of this operation.

Skibidus needs your help determining whether he can sort $$$a$$$ in non-decreasing order$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ by performing the above operation some number of times.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$\textbf{m = 1}$$$).

The following line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).

The following line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, if it is possible to sort $$$a$$$ in non-decreasing order, print "YES" on a new line. Otherwise, print "NO" on a new line.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will also be recognized as positive responses.

Skibidus gives you three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$. He asks for your help to construct a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n+m$$$ with exactly $$$n$$$ $$$\texttt{0}$$$'s and $$$m$$$ $$$\texttt{1}$$$'s such that the maximum balance-value among all of its substrings$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ is exactly $$$k$$$.

If such a value does not exist, then the sequence does not have a majority. For example, the sequence $$$[1,3,2,3,3]$$$ has a majority $$$3$$$ because it appears $$$3 > \left \lfloor {\frac{5}{2}} \right \rfloor = 2$$$ times, but $$$[1,2,3,4,5]$$$ and $$$[1,3,2,3,4]$$$ do not have a majority.

For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, please determine if there exists a non-trivial simple path$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ such that $$$i$$$ is the majority of the sequence of integers written on the vertices that form the path.

Input and Output Format:

The second line of each test case contains $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$)  — the integers written on the vertices.

Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, denoting the two vertices connected by an edge ($$$1 \le u_i,v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$).

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ on a separate line. $$$s_i$$$ should be computed as follows:

- Otherwise, $$$s_i$$$ is '0'.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Skibidus thinks he's Him! He proved it by solving this difficult task. Can you also prove yourself?

Given a binary string$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$t$$$, $$$f(t)$$$ is defined as the minimum number of contiguous substrings, each consisting of identical characters, into which $$$t$$$ can be partitioned. For example, $$$f(\texttt{00110001}) = 4$$$ because $$$t$$$ can be partitioned as $$$\texttt{[00][11][000][1]}$$$ where each bracketed segment consists of identical characters.

Skibidus gives you a binary string $$$s$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, a single character of the string is flipped (i.e. $$$\texttt{0}$$$ changes to $$$\texttt{1}$$$ and $$$\texttt{1}$$$ changes to $$$\texttt{0}$$$); changes are saved after the query is processed. After each query, output the sum over all $$$f(b)$$$ where $$$b$$$ is a non-empty subsequence$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of $$$s$$$, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The following line of each test case contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.

The following line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_q$$$ ($$$1 \leq v_i \leq |s|$$$), denoting $$$s_{v_i}$$$ is flipped for the $$$i$$$'th query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers on a single line — the answer after each query modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Dora has a set $$$s$$$ containing integers. In the beginning, she will put all integers in $$$[l, r]$$$ into the set $$$s$$$. That is, an integer $$$x$$$ is initially contained in the set if and only if $$$l \leq x \leq r$$$. Then she allows you to perform the following operations:

- Select three distinct integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ from the set $$$s$$$, such that $$$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, c) = \gcd(a, c) = 1^\dagger$$$.
- Then, remove these three integers from the set $$$s$$$.

What is the maximum number of operations you can perform?

$$$^\dagger$$$Recall that $$$\gcd(x, y)$$$ means the greatest common divisor of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq 1000$$$) — the range of integers in the initial set.

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of operations you can perform.

Formally, there are $$$m$$$ operations that she is going to perform in order. Each of them belongs to one of the two types:

- $$$\texttt{+ l r}$$$. Given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ such that $$$l \leq a_i \leq r$$$, set $$$a_i := a_i + 1$$$.
- $$$\texttt{- l r}$$$. Given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ such that $$$l \leq a_i \leq r$$$, set $$$a_i := a_i - 1$$$.

For example, if the initial array $$$a = [7, 1, 3, 4, 3]$$$, after performing the operation $$$\texttt{+} \space 2 \space 4$$$, the array $$$a = [7, 1, 4, 5, 4]$$$. Then, after performing the operation $$$\texttt{-} \space 1 \space 10$$$, the array $$$a = [6, 0, 3, 4, 3]$$$.

Index is curious about the maximum value in the array $$$a$$$. Please help her find it after each of the $$$m$$$ operations.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial array $$$a$$$.

Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each line corresponds to the operation, in the following format: $$$\texttt{c l r}$$$ ($$$c \in \{\texttt +, \texttt -\}$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are integers, $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9$$$) — the description of the operation.

Note that the elements $$$a_i$$$ may not satisfy $$$1\le a_i\le 10^9$$$ after some operations, as it is shown in the example.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output one single line containing $$$m$$$ integers, with the $$$i$$$-th of them describing the maximum value of the array after the $$$i$$$-th operation.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Dora has just learned the programming language C++!

However, she has completely misunderstood the meaning of C++. She considers it as two kinds of adding operations on the array $$$c$$$ with $$$n$$$ elements. Dora has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. In one operation, she can choose one of the following things to do.

- Choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, and increase $$$c_i$$$ by $$$a$$$.
- Choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, and increase $$$c_i$$$ by $$$b$$$.

Note that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are constants, and they can be the same.

Let's define a range of array $$$d$$$ as $$$\max(d_i) - \min(d_i)$$$. For instance, the range of the array $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ is $$$4 - 1 = 3$$$, the range of the array $$$[5, 2, 8, 2, 2, 1]$$$ is $$$8 - 1 = 7$$$, and the range of the array $$$[3, 3, 3]$$$ is $$$3 - 3 = 0$$$.

After any number of operations (possibly, $$$0$$$), Dora calculates the range of the new array. You need to help Dora minimize this value, but since Dora loves exploring all by herself, you only need to tell her the minimized value.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$c$$$ and the constant values, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial elements of the array $$$c$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible range of the array after any number of operations.

He represents them as a sequence of notes, where each note is encoded as an integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$127$$$ inclusive. The interval between two notes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$|a - b|$$$ semitones.

Boris considers a melody perfect if the interval between each two adjacent notes is either $$$5$$$ semitones or $$$7$$$ semitones.

After composing his latest melodies, he enthusiastically shows you his collection of works. Help Boris Notkin understand whether his melodies are perfect.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of melodies.

Each melody is described by two lines.

The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 50$$$) — the number of notes in the melody.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n}$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_{i} \leq 127$$$) — the notes of the melody.

For each melody, output "YES", if it is perfect; otherwise, output "NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

Now she wants to make it even more beautiful by performing $$$q$$$ operations on it.

Each operation is described by two integers $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le |s|$$$) and $$$v$$$ ($$$v \in \{0, 1\}$$$) and means that the $$$i$$$-th character of the string is assigned the value $$$v$$$ (that is, the assignment $$$s_i = v$$$ is performed).

But Anya loves the number $$$1100$$$, so after each query, she asks you to tell her whether the substring "1100" is present in her string (i.e. there exist such $$$1 \le i \le |s| - 3$$$ that $$$s_{i}s_{i + 1}s_{i + 2}s_{i + 3} = \texttt{1100}$$$).

The first line of the test case contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$), consisting only of the characters "0" and "1". Here $$$|s|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$s$$$.

The next line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq |s|$$$) and $$$v$$$ ($$$v \in \{0, 1\}$$$), describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each query, output "YES", if "1100" is present in Anya's string; otherwise, output "NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

The first thing that Polycarp saw that day as soon as he opened his eyes was a large wall carpet of size $$$n$$$ by $$$m$$$ cells; $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are even integers. Each cell contains one of the digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$.

Polycarp became curious about how many times the number $$$1543$$$ would appear in all layers$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of the carpet when traversed clockwise.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a pair of numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n, m \leq 10^3$$$, $$$n, m$$$ — even integers).

This is followed by $$$n$$$ lines of length $$$m$$$, consisting of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$ — the description of the carpet.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output a single number — the total number of times $$$1543$$$ appears in all layers of the carpet in the order of traversal clockwise.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: A conspiracy of ancient sages, who decided to redirect rivers for their own convenience, has put the world on the brink. But before implementing their grand plan, they decided to carefully think through their strategy — that's what sages do.

There are $$$n$$$ countries, each with exactly $$$k$$$ regions. For the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$i$$$-th country, they calculated the value $$$a_{i,j}$$$, which reflects the amount of water in it.

The sages intend to create channels between the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$i$$$-th country and the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$(i + 1)$$$-th country for all $$$1 \leq i \leq (n - 1)$$$ and for all $$$1 \leq j \leq k$$$.

Since all $$$n$$$ countries are on a large slope, water flows towards the country with the highest number. According to the sages' predictions, after the channel system is created, the new value of the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$i$$$-th country will be $$$b_{i,j} = a_{1,j} | a_{2,j} | ... | a_{i,j}$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise "OR" operation.

After the redistribution of water, the sages aim to choose the most suitable country for living, so they will send you $$$q$$$ queries for consideration.

Each query will contain $$$m$$$ requirements.

Each requirement contains three parameters: the region number $$$r$$$, the sign $$$o$$$ (either "$$$<$$$" or "$$$>$$$"), and the value $$$c$$$. If $$$o$$$ = "$$$<$$$", then in the $$$r$$$-th region of the country you choose, the new value must be strictly less than the limit $$$c$$$, and if $$$o$$$ = "$$$>$$$", it must be strictly greater.

In other words, the chosen country $$$i$$$ must satisfy all $$$m$$$ requirements. If in the current requirement $$$o$$$ = "$$$<$$$", then it must hold that $$$b_{i,r} < c$$$, and if $$$o$$$ = "$$$>$$$", then $$$b_{i,r} > c$$$.

In response to each query, you should output a single integer — the number of the suitable country. If there are multiple such countries, output the smallest one. If no such country exists, output $$$-1$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, k, q \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of countries, regions, and queries, respectively.

Next, there are $$$n$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \dots, a_{i,k}$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^9$$$), where $$$a_{i,j}$$$ is the value of the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$i$$$-th country.

Then, $$$q$$$ queries are described.

The first line of each query contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of requirements.

Then follow $$$m$$$ lines, each containing an integer $$$r$$$, a character $$$o$$$, and an integer $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \leq r \leq k$$$, $$$0 \leq c \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$$$), where $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ are the region number and the value, and $$$o$$$ is either "$$$<$$$" or "$$$>$$$" — the sign.

It is guaranteed that $$$n \cdot k$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ and that the sum of $$$m$$$ across all queries also does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each query, output a single integer on a new line — the smallest number of the suitable country, or $$$-1$$$ if no such country exists.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Alice has been giving gifts to Bob for many years, and she knows that what he enjoys the most is performing bitwise XOR of interesting integers. Bob considers a positive integer $$$x$$$ to be interesting if it satisfies $$$x \not\equiv k (\bmod 2^i)$$$. Therefore, this year for his birthday, she gifted him a super-powerful "XORificator 3000", the latest model.

Bob was very pleased with the gift, as it allowed him to instantly compute the XOR of all interesting integers in any range from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$, inclusive. After all, what else does a person need for happiness? Unfortunately, the device was so powerful that at one point it performed XOR with itself and disappeared. Bob was very upset, and to cheer him up, Alice asked you to write your version of the "XORificator".

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \leq t \leq 10^4)$$$ — the number of XOR queries on the segment. The following $$$t$$$ lines contain the queries, each consisting of the integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$i$$$, $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}$$$, $$$0 \leq i \leq 30$$$, $$$0 \leq k < 2^i)$$$.

The Department of Supernatural Phenomena at the Oxenfurt Academy has opened the Library of Magic, which contains the works of the greatest sorcerers of Redania — $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$$$) types of books, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each book's type number is indicated on its spine. Moreover, each type of book is stored in the library in exactly two copies! And you have been appointed as the librarian.

One night, you wake up to a strange noise and see a creature leaving the building through a window. Three thick tomes of different colors were sticking out of the mysterious thief's backpack. Before you start searching for them, you decide to compute the numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ written on the spines of these books. All three numbers are distinct.

So, you have an unordered set of tomes, which includes one tome with each of the pairwise distinct numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, and two tomes for all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, except for $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$. You want to find these values $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$.

Since you are not working in a simple library, but in the Library of Magic, you can only use one spell in the form of a query to check the presence of books in their place:

- "xor l r" — Bitwise XOR query with parameters $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Let $$$k$$$ be the number of such tomes in the library whose numbers are greater than or equal to $$$l$$$ and less than or equal to $$$r$$$. You will receive the result of the computation $$$v_1 \oplus v_2 \oplus ... \oplus v_k$$$, where $$$v_1 ... v_k$$$ are the numbers on the spines of these tomes, and $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the operation of bitwise exclusive OR.

Since your magical abilities as a librarian are severely limited, you can make no more than $$$150$$$ queries.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 300$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$$$) — the number of types of tomes.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$.

Two players are playing a game. The first player chooses an index $$$1 \le i \le n$$$. Then the second player chooses a different index $$$1 \le j \le n, i \neq j$$$. The first player wins if $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$ is not divisible by $$$k$$$. Otherwise, the second player wins.

We play as the first player. Determine whether it is possible to win, and if so, which index $$$i$$$ should be chosen.

The absolute value of a number $$$x$$$ is denoted by $$$|x|$$$ and is equal to $$$x$$$ if $$$x \ge 0$$$, and $$$-x$$$ otherwise.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 100$$$) — the length of the array and the number $$$k$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

For each test case, if it is impossible for the first player to win, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) and on the next line the appropriate index $$$1 \le i \le n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer.

You can perform two types of operations on it:

1. Choose an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le n$$$ and $$$a_i = 0$$$, and assign $$$1$$$ to $$$a_i$$$;
2. Choose a pair of indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$, $$$a_l = 1$$$, $$$a_r = 1$$$, $$$a_l + \ldots + a_r \ge \lceil\frac{r - l + 1}{2}\rceil$$$, and assign $$$1$$$ to $$$a_i$$$ for all $$$l \le i \le r$$$.

What is the minimum number of operations of the first type needed to make all elements of the array equal to one?

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.

Note that there is no limit on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of needed operations of first type.

Let's place a robot in some vertex $$$v \ne 1$$$, and suppose we initially have $$$p$$$ coins. Consider the following process, where in the $$$i$$$-th step (starting from $$$i = 1$$$):

- If $$$i$$$ is odd, the robot moves to an adjacent vertex in the direction of vertex $$$1$$$;
- Else, $$$i$$$ is even. You can either pay one coin (if there are some left) and then the robot moves to an adjacent vertex in the direction of vertex $$$1$$$, or not pay, and then the robot moves to an adjacent vertex chosen uniformly at random.

The process stops as soon as the robot reaches vertex $$$1$$$. Let $$$f(v, p)$$$ be the minimum possible expected number of steps in the process above if we spend our coins optimally.

Answer $$$q$$$ queries, in the $$$i$$$-th of which you have to find the value of $$$f(v_i, p_i)$$$, modulo$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^3$$$; $$$1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^3$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.

The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$v_i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$ ($$$2 \le v_i \le n$$$; $$$0 \le p_i \le n$$$).

It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10 ^ 3$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10 ^ 3$$$.

For each test case, print $$$q$$$ integers: the values of $$$f(v_i, p_i)$$$ modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Formally, let $$$M = 998\,244\,353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.

Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Álvaro and José are the only candidates running for the presidency of Tepito, a rectangular grid of $$$2$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns, where each cell represents a house. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is a multiple of $$$3$$$.

Under the voting system of Tepito, the grid will be split into districts, which consist of any $$$3$$$ houses that are connected$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$. Each house will belong to exactly one district.

Each district will cast a single vote. The district will vote for Álvaro or José respectively if at least $$$2$$$ houses in that district select them. Therefore, a total of $$$\frac{2n}{3}$$$ votes will be cast.

As Álvaro is the current president, he knows exactly which candidate each house will select. If Álvaro divides the houses into districts optimally, determine the maximum number of votes he can get.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^5$$$; $$$n$$$ is a multiple of $$$3$$$) — the number of columns of Tepito.

The following two lines each contain a string of length $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th line contains the string $$$s_i$$$, consisting of the characters $$$\texttt{A}$$$ and $$$\texttt{J}$$$. If $$$s_{i,j}=\texttt{A}$$$, the house in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column will select Álvaro. Otherwise if $$$s_{i,j}=\texttt{J}$$$, the house will select José.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of districts Álvaro can win by optimally dividing the houses into districts.

This is an interactive problem.

It is a tradition in Mexico's national IOI trainings to play the game "Asesino", which is similar to "Among Us" or "Mafia".

Today, $$$n$$$ players, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, will play "Asesino" with the following three roles:

- Knight: a Knight is someone who always tells the truth.
- Knave: a Knave is someone who always lies.
- Impostor: an Impostor is someone everybody thinks is a Knight, but is secretly a Knave.

Each player will be assigned a role in the game. There will be exactly one Impostor but there can be any (possible zero) number of Knights and Knaves.

As the game moderator, you have accidentally forgotten the roles of everyone, but you need to determine the player who is the Impostor.

To determine the Impostor, you will ask some questions. In each question, you will pick two players $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$; $$$i \neq j$$$) and ask if player $$$i$$$ thinks that player $$$j$$$ is a Knight. The results of the question is shown in the table below.

KnightKnaveImpostorKnightYesNoYesKnaveNoYesNoImpostorNoYes— The response of the cell in row $$$a$$$ and column $$$b$$$ is the result of asking a question when $$$i$$$ has role $$$a$$$ and $$$j$$$ has row $$$b$$$. For example, the "Yes" in the top right cell belongs to row "Knight" and column "Impostor", so it is the response when $$$i$$$ is a Knight and $$$j$$$ is an Impostor.

Find the Impostor in at most $$$n + 69$$$ questions.

Note: the grader is adaptive: the roles of the players are not fixed in the beginning and may change depending on your questions. However, it is guaranteed that there exists an assignment of roles that is consistent with all previously asked questions under the constraints of this problem.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of people playing the game.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. In this version, it is guaranteed that $$$q = 0$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

An integer grid $$$A$$$ with $$$p$$$ rows and $$$q$$$ columns is called beautiful if:

- All elements of the grid are integers between $$$0$$$ and $$$2^{30}-1$$$, and
- For any subgrid, the XOR of the values at the corners is equal to $$$0$$$. Formally, for any four integers $$$i_1$$$, $$$i_2$$$, $$$j_1$$$, $$$j_2$$$ ($$$1 \le i_1 < i_2 \le p$$$; $$$1 \le j_1 < j_2 \le q$$$), $$$A_{i_1, j_1} \oplus A_{i_1, j_2} \oplus A_{i_2, j_1} \oplus A_{i_2, j_2} = 0$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

There is a partially filled integer grid $$$G$$$ with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns where only $$$k$$$ cells are filled. Polycarp wants to know how many ways he can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful.

However, Monocarp thinks that this problem is too easy. Therefore, he will perform $$$q$$$ updates on the grid. In each update, he will choose an unfilled cell and assign an integer to it. Note that these updates are persistent. That is, changes made to the grid will apply when processing future updates.

For each of the $$$q + 1$$$ states of the grid, the initial state and after each of the $$$q$$$ queries, determine the number of ways Polycarp can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful. Since this number can be very large, you are only required to output their values modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 10^5$$$; $$$0 \le k \le 10^5$$$; $$$q = 0$$$) — the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of fixed cells, and the number of updates.

The following $$$k$$$ lines contain three integers $$$r$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le r \le n, 1 \le c \le m$$$; $$$0 \le v < 2^{30}$$$) — indicating that $$$G_{r, c}$$$ is assigned the integer $$$v$$$.

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain three integers $$$r$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le r \le n, 1 \le c \le m$$$; $$$0 \le v < 2^{30}$$$) — indicating that $$$G_{r, c}$$$ is assigned the integer $$$v$$$.

It is guaranteed that the pairs $$$(r,c)$$$ over all assignments are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ respectively.

For each test case, output $$$q + 1$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line of output should contain the answer of the $$$i$$$-th state of the grid modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

An integer grid $$$A$$$ with $$$p$$$ rows and $$$q$$$ columns is called beautiful if:

- All elements of the grid are integers between $$$0$$$ and $$$2^{30}-1$$$, and
- For any subgrid, the XOR of the values at the corners is equal to $$$0$$$. Formally, for any four integers $$$i_1$$$, $$$i_2$$$, $$$j_1$$$, $$$j_2$$$ ($$$1 \le i_1 < i_2 \le p$$$; $$$1 \le j_1 < j_2 \le q$$$), $$$A_{i_1, j_1} \oplus A_{i_1, j_2} \oplus A_{i_2, j_1} \oplus A_{i_2, j_2} = 0$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

There is a partially filled integer grid $$$G$$$ with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns where only $$$k$$$ cells are filled. Polycarp wants to know how many ways he can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful.

However, Monocarp thinks that this problem is too easy. Therefore, he will perform $$$q$$$ updates on the grid. In each update, he will choose an unfilled cell and assign an integer to it. Note that these updates are persistent. That is, changes made to the grid will apply when processing future updates.

For each of the $$$q + 1$$$ states of the grid, the initial state and after each of the $$$q$$$ queries, determine the number of ways Polycarp can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful. Since this number can be very large, you are only required to output their values modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 10^5$$$; $$$0 \le k, q \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of fixed cells, and the number of updates.

The following $$$k$$$ lines contain three integers $$$r$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le r \le n, 1 \le c \le m$$$; $$$0 \le v < 2^{30}$$$) indicating that $$$G_{r, c}$$$ is assigned the integer $$$v$$$.

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain three integers $$$r$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le r \le n, 1 \le c \le m$$$; $$$0 \le v < 2^{30}$$$) indicating that $$$G_{r, c}$$$ is assigned the integer $$$v$$$.

It is guaranteed that the pairs $$$(r,c)$$$ over all assignments are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ respectively.

For each test case, output $$$q + 1$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line of output should contain the answer of the $$$i$$$-th state of the grid modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

To demonstrate the power of his blender, Zhan has $$$n$$$ fruits.

The blender can mix up to $$$x$$$ fruits per second.

In each second, Zhan can put up to $$$y$$$ fruits into the blender. After that, the blender will blend $$$\min(x, c)$$$ fruits, where $$$c$$$ is the number of fruits inside the blender. After blending, blended fruits are removed from the blender.

Help Zhan determine the minimum amount of time required for Zhan to blend all fruits.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$0 \le n \le 10^9$$$) — the number of fruits Zhan has.

The second line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le x, y \le 10^9$$$) — the number of fruits the blender can blend per second and the number of fruits Zhan can put into the blender per second.

For each testcase, output a single integer — the minimum number of seconds to blend all fruits.

However, he could not solve it either, so we ask you to try to solve this problem.

You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. We can perform any number (possibly, zero) of operations on the array.

In one operation, we choose a position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n - 1$$$) and perform the following action:

- $$$a_i := a_i - 1$$$, and $$$a_{i+1} := a_{i+1} + 1$$$.

Find the minimum possible value of $$$\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) - \min(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$$$.

Alice and Bob are playing a fun game on a tree. This game is played on a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Recall that a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph with $$$n - 1$$$ edges.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first. Each player starts at some vertex.

On their turn, a player must move from the current vertex to a neighboring vertex that has not yet been visited by anyone. The first player who cannot make a move loses.

You are given two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Represent the simple path from vertex $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ as an array $$$p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_m$$$, where $$$p_1 = u$$$, $$$p_m = v$$$, and there is an edge between $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i < m$$$).

You need to determine the winner of the game if Alice starts at vertex $$$1$$$ and Bob starts at vertex $$$p_j$$$ for each $$$j$$$ (where $$$1 \le j \le m$$$).

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le n$$$), denoting an undirected edge between vertices $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.

The last line of each test case contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$2 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$\mathbf{u = v}$$$).

It is guaranteed that the path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ does not pass through vertex $$$1$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$m$$$ lines.

In the $$$i$$$-th line, print the winner of the game if Alice starts at vertex $$$1$$$ and Bob starts at vertex $$$p_i$$$. Print "Alice" (without quotes) if Alice wins, or "Bob" (without quotes) otherwise.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, it is not guaranteed that $$$u = v$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

Alice and Bob are playing a fun game on a tree. This game is played on a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Recall that a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph with $$$n - 1$$$ edges.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first. Each player starts at some vertex.

On their turn, a player must move from the current vertex to a neighboring vertex that has not yet been visited by anyone. The first player who cannot make a move loses.

You are given two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Represent the simple path from vertex $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ as an array $$$p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_m$$$, where $$$p_1 = u$$$, $$$p_m = v$$$, and there is an edge between $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i < m$$$).

You need to determine the winner of the game if Alice starts at vertex $$$1$$$ and Bob starts at vertex $$$p_j$$$ for each $$$j$$$ (where $$$1 \le j \le m$$$).

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le n$$$), denoting an undirected edge between vertices $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.

The last line of each test case contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$2 \le u, v \le n$$$).

It is guaranteed that the path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ does not pass through vertex $$$1$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$m$$$ lines.

In the $$$i$$$-th line, print the winner of the game if Alice starts at vertex $$$1$$$ and Bob starts at vertex $$$p_i$$$. Print "Alice" (without quotes) if Alice wins, or "Bob" (without quotes) otherwise.

However, UFO doesn't know how to construct array $$$b$$$, so you must help her. Note that $$$1 \leq b_i \leq n$$$ must hold for your array for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$.

Input and Output Format:

Robot gives you an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$. You construct a $$$n$$$ by $$$m$$$ grid $$$M$$$ such that $$$M_{i,j}=a_i\cdot b_j$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ and $$$1 \leq j \leq m$$$.

Then, Robot gives you $$$q$$$ queries, each consisting of a single integer $$$x$$$. For each query, determine whether or not it is possible to perform the following operation exactly once so that $$$M$$$ has a beauty of $$$x$$$:

1. Choose integers $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ such that $$$1 \leq r \leq n$$$ and $$$1 \leq c \leq m$$$
2. Set $$$M_{i,j}$$$ to be $$$0$$$ for all ordered pairs $$$(i,j)$$$ such that $$$i=r$$$, $$$j=c$$$, or both.

Note that queries are not persistent, meaning that you do not actually set any elements to $$$0$$$ in the process — you are only required to output if it is possible to find $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ such that if the above operation is performed, the beauty of the grid will be $$$x$$$. Also, note that you must perform the operation for each query, even if the beauty of the original grid is already $$$x$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n,m \leq 2\cdot 10^5, 1 \leq q \leq 5\cdot 10^4$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$, the length of $$$b$$$, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq |a_i| \leq n$$$).

The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$0 \leq |b_i| \leq m$$$).

The following $$$q$$$ lines each contain a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq |x| \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$), the beauty of the grid you wish to achieve by setting all elements in a row and a column to $$$0$$$.

For each testcase, output "YES" (without quotes) if there is a way to perform the aforementioned operation such that the beauty is $$$x$$$, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

A group of $$$n$$$ spiders has come together to exchange plushies. Initially, each spider has $$$1$$$ plushie. Every year, if spider $$$i$$$ has at least one plushie, he will give exactly one plushie to spider $$$r_i$$$. Otherwise, he will do nothing. Note that all plushie transfers happen at the same time. In this version, if any spider has more than $$$1$$$ plushie at any point in time, they will throw all but $$$1$$$ away.

The process is stable in the current year if each spider has the same number of plushies (before the current year's exchange) as he did the previous year (before the previous year's exchange). Note that year $$$1$$$ can never be stable.

Find the first year in which the process becomes stable.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of spiders.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. The key difference between the two versions is highlighted in bold.

A group of $$$n$$$ spiders has come together to exchange plushies. Initially, each spider has $$$1$$$ plushie. Every year, if spider $$$i$$$ has at least one plushie, he will give exactly one plushie to spider $$$r_i$$$. Otherwise, he will do nothing. Note that all plushie transfers happen at the same time. In this version, each spider is allowed to have more than 1 plushie at any point in time.

The process is stable in the current year if each spider has the same number of plushies (before the current year's exchange) as he did the previous year (before the previous year's exchange). Note that year $$$1$$$ can never be stable.

Find the first year in which the process becomes stable.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of spiders.

The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq r_i \leq n, r_i \neq i$$$) — the recipient of the plushie of each spider.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output an integer on a new line, the first year in which the process becomes stable.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: Swing is opening a pancake factory! A good pancake factory must be good at flattening things, so Swing is going to test his new equipment on 2D matrices.

Swing is given an $$$n \times n$$$ matrix $$$M$$$ containing positive integers. He has $$$q$$$ queries to ask you.

For each query, he gives you four integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, $$$y_2$$$ and asks you to flatten the submatrix bounded by $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ into an array $$$A$$$. Formally, $$$A = [M_{(x1,y1)}, M_{(x1,y1+1)}, \ldots, M_{(x1,y2)}, M_{(x1+1,y1)}, M_{(x1+1,y1+1)}, \ldots, M_{(x2,y2)}]$$$.

The following image depicts the flattening of a submatrix bounded by the red dotted lines. The orange arrows denote the direction that the elements of the submatrix are appended to the back of $$$A$$$, and $$$A$$$ is shown at the bottom of the image.

Afterwards, he asks you for the value of $$$\sum_{i=1}^{|A|} A_i \cdot i$$$ (sum of $$$A_i \cdot i$$$ over all $$$i$$$).

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2000, 1 \leq q \leq 10^6$$$) — the length of $$$M$$$ and the number of queries.

The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ integers each, the $$$i$$$'th of which contains $$$M_{(i,1)}, M_{(i,2)}, \ldots, M_{(i,n)}$$$ ($$$1 \leq M_{(i, j)} \leq 10^6$$$).

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain four integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, and $$$y_2$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq n, 1 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq n$$$) — the bounds of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output the results of the $$$q$$$ queries on a new line.

user: Please solve this Codeforces problem by writing a Python solution. Return only the code and nothing else.Problem: There is a shop that sells action figures near Monocarp's house. A new set of action figures will be released shortly; this set contains $$$n$$$ figures, the $$$i$$$-th figure costs $$$i$$$ coins and is available for purchase from day $$$i$$$ to day $$$n$$$.

For each of the $$$n$$$ days, Monocarp knows whether he can visit the shop.

Every time Monocarp visits the shop, he can buy any number of action figures which are sold in the shop (of course, he cannot buy an action figure that is not yet available for purchase). If Monocarp buys at least two figures during the same day, he gets a discount equal to the cost of the most expensive figure he buys (in other words, he gets the most expensive of the figures he buys for free).

Monocarp wants to buy exactly one $$$1$$$-st figure, one $$$2$$$-nd figure, ..., one $$$n$$$-th figure from the set. He cannot buy the same figure twice. What is the minimum amount of money he has to spend?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

- the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 4 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of figures in the set (and the number of days);
- the second line contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$|s| = n$$$, each $$$s_i$$$ is either 0 or 1). If Monocarp can visit the shop on the $$$i$$$-th day, then $$$s_i$$$ is 1; otherwise, $$$s_i$$$ is 0.

Additional constraints on the input:

- in each test case, $$$s_n$$$ is 1, so Monocarp is always able to buy all figures during the $$$n$$$-th day;
- the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum amount of money Monocarp has to spend.

- $$$4~x~p$$$ — for store $$$x$$$, find the maximum total tastiness of a subset of types of ice cream that are sold there, such that the total price does not exceed $$$p$$$ (each type can be used in the subset no more than once).

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of queries.
