The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ are smaller. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nNow Little John is rich, and so he finally buys a house big enough to fit himself and his favorite bracket sequence. But somehow, he ended up with a lot of brackets! Frustrated, he penetrates through the ceiling with the \"buddha palm\".\n\nA bracket sequence is called balanced if it can be constructed by the following formal grammar.\n\n1. The empty sequence $$$\\varnothing$$$ is balanced.\n2. If the bracket sequence $$$A$$$ is balanced, then $$$\\mathtt{(}A\\mathtt{)}$$$ is also balanced.\n3. If the bracket sequences $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are balanced, then the concatenated sequence $$$A B$$$ is also balanced.\n\nFor example, the sequences \"(())()\", \"()\", \"(()(()))\", and the empty sequence are balanced, while \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not.\n\nGiven a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$, a pair of indices $$$(i,j)$$$ ($$$i<j$$$) is called a good pair if $$$s_i$$$ is '(', $$$s_j$$$ is ')', and the two brackets are added simultaneously with respect to Rule 2 while constructing the sequence $$$s$$$. For example, the sequence \"(())()\" has three different good pairs, which are $$$(1,4)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, and $$$(5,6)$$$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $$$2n$$$ brackets contains exactly $$$n$$$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.\n\nEmily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.\n\nInitially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $$$n$$$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.\n\nThroughout $$$n$$$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.\n\n- $$$l\\;r$$$: The sequence $$$s$$$ contains a good pair $$$(l,r)$$$.\n\nThe clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.\n\nAt a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $$$s$$$ has $$$3$$$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Out of $$$5$$$ balanced bracket sequences with $$$3$$$ good pairs, there exists only one such sequence \"((()))\" with the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need $$$n$$$ turns to guess $$$s$$$.\n\nTo find out the content of $$$s$$$ as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn. As the answers may be huge, you need to find them modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) — the number of good pairs.\n\nThen, each of the $$$n$$$ following lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ representing the $$$i$$$-th clue ($$$1 \\le l_i < r_i \\le 2n$$$).\n\nThe clues in one test case are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.\n\nFor each test case, output $$$n+1$$$ integers on a separate line:\n\n- The first integer is the answer before all clues, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n- For all $$$i \\ge 1$$$, the $$$i+1$$$-th integer is the answer after the $$$i$$$-th clue, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nInputs:\n3\n3\n2 5\n1 6\n3 4\n4\n1 6\n7 8\n2 3\n4 5\n6\n2 3\n1 6\n7 8\n9 12\n10 11\n4 5\n\n\nOutputs:\n5 1 1 1\n14 2 2 1 1\n132 42 5 2 1 1 1\n"

There are $$$n$$$ different types of cards in their card game. Alice currently has a card of type $$$1$$$ and needs a card of type $$$n$$$ to escape Wonderland. The other players have one of each kind of card.\n\nIn this card game, Alice can trade cards with the three other players. Each player has different preferences for the $$$n$$$ types of cards, which can be described by permutations$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$q$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$j$$$ for the Queen, King, and Jack, respectively.\n\nA player values card $$$a$$$ more than card $$$b$$$ if for their permutation $$$p$$$, $$$p_a > p_b$$$. Then, this player is willing to trade card $$$b$$$ to Alice in exchange for card $$$a$$$. Alice's preferences are straightforward: she values card $$$a$$$ more than card $$$b$$$ if $$$a > b$$$, and she will also only trade according to these preferences.\n\nDetermine if Alice can trade up from card $$$1$$$ to card $$$n$$$ subject to these preferences, and if it is possible, give a possible set of trades to do it.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of card types.\n\nThe next three lines contain the preferences of the Queen, King, and Jack respectively. Each of these lines contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1\\le p_i\\le n$$$) — a permutation corresponding to the player's preferences.\n\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nFor each test case, on the first line output a single string \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without the quotes) denoting whether Alice can trade up to card $$$n$$$.\n\nIf the first line was \"YES\", then on the next line output $$$k$$$ — the number of trades Alice will make. On the next $$$k$$$ lines output space separated a character $$$c\\in \\{\\texttt{q}, \\texttt{k}, \\texttt{j}\\}$$$ and integer $$$x$$$, denoting that Alice trades with player $$$c$$$ to get card $$$x$$$. It must be the case that on the $$$k$$$'th line, $$$x = n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nYou can output this answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses. The same goes for the character $$$c$$$ denoting the player in the trade ($$$\\texttt{Q}, \\texttt{K}, \\texttt{J}$$$ will all be accepted alongside their lowercase variants).\n\nInputs:\n2\n3\n1 3 2\n2 1 3\n1 2 3\n4\n2 3 1 4\n1 2 3 4\n1 4 2 3\n\n\nOutputs:\nYES\n2\nk 2\nq 3\nNO\n"

Return only the code and nothing else.\n\n\nProblem: Two of Farmer John's cows, Bessie and Elsie, are planning to race on $$$n$$$ islands. There are $$$n - 1$$$ main bridges, connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$i + 1$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1$$$. Additionally, there are $$$m$$$ alternative bridges. Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.\n\nInitially, Elsie starts on island $$$1$$$, and Bessie starts on island $$$s$$$. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island $$$i$$$. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$j$$$, then the cow can move to island $$$j$$$. Then, island $$$i$$$ collapses, and all bridges connecting to island $$$i$$$ also collapse. Also, note the following:\n\n- If there are no bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to another island, then island $$$i$$$ collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.\n- If the other cow is also on island $$$i$$$, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.\n- After an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.\n- If a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.\n\nThe race ends once either cow reaches island $$$n$$$. It can be shown that regardless of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island $$$n$$$. Bessie wins if and only if she reaches island $$$n$$$ first.\n\nFor each $$$1 \\leq s \\leq n - 1$$$, determine whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island $$$s$$$. Assume both cows follow optimal strategies to ensure their own respective victories.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) – the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) – the number of islands and the number of alternative bridges.\n\nThe next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case contain $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u < v \\leq n$$$) – the islands that the alternative bridge connects. It is guaranteed all alternative bridges are distinct, and they do not coincide with the main bridges.\n\nIt is guaranteed that neither the sum of $$$n$$$ nor the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases exceeds $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nFor each test case, output a binary string of length $$$n - 1$$$ on a new line. The $$$i$$$'th character is $$$1$$$ if it is possible for Bessie to win if she starts on island $$$i$$$. Otherwise, it is $$$0$$$.\n\nInputs:\n5\n6 0\n6 1\n2 6\n6 1\n1 5\n10 4\n1 3\n1 6\n2 7\n3 8\n15 3\n2 8\n4 9\n8 15\n\n\nOutputs:\n11111\n11011\n10011\n100001111\n11000111000111\n"

Suppose $$$r$$$ is the smallest element in $$$S$$$ which is greater than $$$l$$$.   If $$$a_l > a_r$$$, you set $$$a_l = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If $$$a_l < a_r$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$.  If $$$a_l = a_r$$$, you choose either the integer $$$l$$$ or $$$r$$$ to remove from $$$S$$$:   If you choose to remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$.

Return only the code and nothing else.\n\n\nProblem: Narek is too lazy to create the third problem of this contest. His friend Artur suggests that he should use ChatGPT. ChatGPT creates $$$n$$$ problems, each consisting of $$$m$$$ letters, so Narek has $$$n$$$ strings. To make the problem harder, he combines the problems by selecting some of the $$$n$$$ strings possibly none and concatenating them without altering their order. His chance of solving the problem is defined as $$$score_n - score_c$$$, where $$$score_n$$$ is Narek's score and $$$score_c$$$ is ChatGPT's score.\n\nNarek calculates $$$score_n$$$ by examining the selected string (he moves from left to right). He initially searches for the letter $$$\\texttt{\"n\"}$$$, followed by $$$\\texttt{\"a\"}$$$, $$$\\texttt{\"r\"}$$$, $$$\\texttt{\"e\"}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{\"k\"}$$$. Upon finding all occurrences of these letters, he increments $$$score_n$$$ by $$$5$$$ and resumes searching for $$$\\texttt{\"n\"}$$$ again (he doesn't go back, and he just continues from where he left off).\n\nAfter Narek finishes, ChatGPT scans through the array and increments $$$score_c$$$ by $$$1$$$ for each letter $$$\\texttt{\"n\"}$$$, $$$\\texttt{\"a\"}$$$, $$$\\texttt{\"r\"}$$$, $$$\\texttt{\"e\"}$$$, or $$$\\texttt{\"k\"}$$$ that Narek fails to utilize (note that if Narek fails to complete the last occurrence by finding all of the $$$5$$$ letters, then all of the letters he used are counted in ChatGPT's score $$$score_c$$$, and Narek doesn't get any points if he doesn't finish finding all the 5 letters).\n\nNarek aims to maximize the value of $$$score_n - score_c$$$ by selecting the most optimal subset of the initial strings.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nIn the first line of the input, you're given a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$), the number of test cases.

The strings only contain lowercase letters of the English alphabet.\n\nThe sum of values of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximal possible value of $$$score_n - score_c$$$.\n\nInputs:\n4\n5 2\nnn\naa\nrr\nee\nkk\n1 5\nnarek\n1 4\nnare\n5 7\nnrrarek\nnrnekan\nuuuuuuu\nppppppp\nnkarekz\n\n\nOutputs:\n0\n5\n0\n7\n"

The differences between the two versions are the constraints on all the variables. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\nTsovak and Narek are playing a game. They have an array $$$a$$$ and a matrix $$$b$$$ of integers with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, numbered from $$$1$$$. The cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$(i, j)$$$.\n\nThey are looking for the elements of $$$a$$$ in turns; Tsovak starts first. Each time a player looks for a cell in the matrix containing the current element of $$$a$$$ (Tsovak looks for the first, then Narek looks for the second, etc.). Let's say a player has chosen the cell $$$(r, c)$$$. The next player has to choose his cell in the submatrix starting at $$$(r + 1, c + 1)$$$ and ending in $$$(n, m)$$$ (the submatrix can be empty if $$$r=n$$$ or $$$c=m$$$). If a player cannot find such a cell (or the remaining submatrix is empty) or the array ends (the previous player has chosen the last element), then he loses.\n\nYour task is to determine the winner if the players play optimally.\n\nNote: since the input is large, you may need to optimize input/output for this problem.\n\nFor example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line of the input contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1500$$$) – the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $$$l$$$, $$$n$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le l, n, m \\le 1500$$$) – the size of the array and the sizes of the matrix.\n\nThe second line contains $$$l$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots a_l$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n \\cdot m$$$) – the elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the last $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}, b_{i,3}, \\ldots b_{i,m}$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_{i,j} \\le n \\cdot m$$$) – representing the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^6$$$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$l$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1500$$$.\n\nYou should output $$$t$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of them containing a character representing the answer of the $$$i$$$-th test case: \"T\" if Tsovak wins or \"N\", otherwise (without quotes).\n\nInputs:\n3\n2 2 3\n1 2\n1 3 6\n4 6 2\n2 2 4\n1 2\n1 1 3 2\n4 2 5 1\n2 4 2\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n7 8\n8 8\n\n\nOutputs:\nN\nT\nN\n"

Their boss promises to give them a bonus if they complete an additional project. The project requires $$$k$$$ units of work in total. The bonus promised to the $$$i$$$-th engineer is $$$a_i$$$ burles. The boss doesn't assign specific tasks to engineers; it is expected that every engineer will voluntarily complete some integer amount of work units. The bonus will be paid to the entire team only if the project is completed; in other words, if the total amount of voluntary work units on the project is greater than or equal to $$$k$$$.\n\nThe amount of work that can be performed by each engineer is not limited. However, all engineers value their labour. The $$$i$$$-th engineer estimates one unit of their work as $$$b_i$$$ burles. If the bonus is paid, the benefit $$$s_i$$$ of the $$$i$$$-th engineer for completing $$$c$$$ units of work is defined as $$$s_i = a_i - c \\cdot b_i$$$. If the bonus is not paid, the engineer will not volunteer to do any work.\n\nEngineers work together for many years, so they know how the bonus is going to be distributed and how much their colleagues value the labour.

Initially, the $$$i$$$-th barrel has $$$v_i$$$ units of water.\n\nAdjacent barrels are connected by pipes. In other words, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, barrels $$$i$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$ are connected by a single horizontal pipe at height $$$h_i$$$. The widths of the pipes are negligible. These pipes allow water to flow between barrels.\n\nNow you want to play with barrels. Your plan is to maximize the volume of the water in the first barrel by throwing clay into barrels. In one step, you can choose any barrel and throw one unit of clay into it. One unit of clay has the same volume as one unit of water. Clay is heavier than water and doesn't mix with it, so it falls to the bottom of the barrel, distributing evenly.\n\nClay has a sticky structure, so it seals pipes if the clay column is high enough. More formally, suppose the pipe is at height $$$h$$$. If the height of the clay column is also $$$\\boldsymbol{h}$$$ (or lower), the pipe is working. But the moment you add more clay into the barrel, the pipe becomes sealed instantly, preventing any water from moving between barrels.\n\nYou have a mountain of clay, so you can repeat the step described above any number of times. However, between the steps, you have to wait until the water reaches the new equilibrium.\n\nWhat is the maximum water volume you can collect in the first barrel?\n\nAssume that the barrels are high enough, so the water doesn't overflow, and the pipe widths are negligible.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of barrels.\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le v_i \\le 10^6$$$), where $$$v_i$$$ is the initial water volume in the $$$i$$$-th barrel.\n\nThe third line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_{n - 1}$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i \\le 10^6$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the height of the pipe between the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$(i + 1)$$$-st barrel.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: the given water heights are in an equilibrium.\n\nPrint a single number — the maximum volume of water in the first barrel.

Similar to biathlon being a competition of two sports, polyathlon is a competition of many sports. This year, there are $$$m$$$ sports. Also, there are $$$n$$$ participants in the event. The sports are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, and the participants are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.\n\nSome participants are skilled in multiple sports. You are given a binary matrix $$$n \\times m$$$ such that the $$$j$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th row is 1 if the $$$i$$$-th participant is skilled in the $$$j$$$-th sport, and 0, otherwise. It's also known that, for each pair of participants, there exists at least one sport such that one of them is skilled in that sport and the other one isn't.\n\nThe order of sports in the competition is determined at the opening ceremony. Historically, it's done by the almighty Random Number Generator. A random number $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ is rolled. The competition then starts with the sport $$$x$$$, then the sport $$$(x \\bmod m + 1)$$$ is played, then the sport $$$((x + 1) \\bmod m + 1)$$$, and so on.\n\nEach sport is played as follows. If all remaining participants (all participants which are not eliminated yet) are not skilled in that sport, everyone goes through to the next sport. Otherwise, all skilled participants go through to the next sport, and all unskilled participants are eliminated from the competition. Once there is a single participant remaining in the competition, the competition ends, and that participant is declared the winner.\n\nAs an organizer of the competition, you are curious of the possible outcomes of the competition beforehand (not that you are going to rig the random roll, how could you possibly think that...).

If the $$$j$$$-th character is 1, the $$$i$$$-th participant is skilled in the $$$j$$$-th sport. If it's 0, the $$$i$$$-th participant is not skilled in the $$$j$$$-th sport.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: for each pair of participants, there exists at least one sport such that one of them is skilled in that sport and the other one isn't. In other words, all $$$n$$$ binary strings are pairwise distinct.\n\nPrint $$$m$$$ integers.

For each suit, there are $$$13$$$ cards in the deck, all with different ranks (the ranks are $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, ..., $$$10$$$, Jack, Queen, King and Ace).\n\nInitially, the deck is shuffled randomly (all $$$(13n)!$$$ possible orders of cards have the same probability). You draw $$$5$$$ topmost cards from the deck. Then, every turn of the game, the following events happen, in the given order:\n\n1. if the cards in your hand form a Royal Flush (a $$$10$$$, a Jack, a Queen, a King, and an Ace, all of the same suit), you win, and the game ends;\n2. if you haven't won yet, and the deck is empty, you lose, and the game ends;\n3. if the game hasn't ended yet, you may choose any cards from your hand (possibly, all of them) and discard them. When a card is discarded, it is removed from the game;\n4. finally, you draw cards from the deck, until you have $$$5$$$ cards or the deck becomes empty.\n\nYour goal is to find a strategy that allows you to win in the minimum expected number of turns. Note that the turn when the game ends is not counted (for example, if the $$$5$$$ cards you draw initially already form a Royal Flush, you win in $$$0$$$ turns).\n\nCalculate the minimum possible expected number of turns required to win the game.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe only line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 4$$$) — the number of suits used in the game.\n\nPrint the minimum expected number of turns.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.

It is played in rounds. During each round, every player chooses one of three moves: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Depending on the chosen moves, the following happens:\n\n- if one player chooses Rock and the other player chooses Paper, the player who chooses Paper wins and gets a point;\n- if one player chooses Scissors and the other player chooses Paper, the player who chooses Scissors wins and gets a point;\n- if one player chooses Scissors and the other player chooses Rock, the player who chooses Rock wins and gets a point;\n- and if both players choose the same move, nobody wins and nobody gets a point.\n\nMonocarp decided to play against a bot. During the game, Monocarp noticed that the bot's behavior is very predictable:\n\n- in the first round, it chooses Rock;\n- in every round except the first, it chooses the move that beats the opponent's move in the previous round (for example, if in the previous round its opponent played Scissors, then the bot chooses Rock now).\n\nMonocarp has a favorite string $$$s$$$, consisting of the characters R, P, and/or S.

In the $$$i$$$-th line, the first number is an integer $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le k_i \\le n$$$) — the number of participants from the $$$i$$$-th city. It is followed by $$$k_i$$$ integers $$$q_{i, 1}, q_{i, 2}, \\ldots, q_{i, k_i}$$$ — ($$$1 \\le q_{i, j} \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le j \\le k_i$$$) — the indices of the participants from this city. It is guaranteed that each participant is mentioned exactly once.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nFor each test case, if there exists a set of problems that satisfies Cheops' conditions, then in the first line output a single integer $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\le p \\le 5n$$$) — the number of problems in your solution.\n\nThen output $$$p$$$ lines, each containing two integers $$$d$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$0 \\le d, t \\le {10}^9$$$) — the difficulty and topic of the respective problem. The topics must be distinct.\n\nIf there is no set of problems that meets Cheops' wishes, print $$$-1$$$ instead.\n\nInputs:\n2\n5 2\n5 7 1\n6 7 2\n3 9 2\n5 10 3\n4 4 1\n2 1 2\n3 3 4 5\n2 2\n1 2 1\n1 2 1\n1 2\n1 1\n\n\nOutputs:\n7\n6 4\n6 5\n5 6\n5 7\n4 8\n4 9\n7 1\n-1\n"

You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nFor a long time, no one could decipher Sumerian cuneiform. However, it has finally succumbed to pressure! Today, you have the chance to decipher Yandex cuneiform.\n\nYandex cuneiform is defined by the following rules:\n\n1. An empty string is a Yandex cuneiform.\n2. If you insert exactly one copy of each of the three letters 'Y', 'D', and 'X' into a Yandex cuneiform in such a way that no two adjacent letters become equal after the operation, you obtain a Yandex cuneiform.\n3. If a string can't be obtained using the above rules, it is not a Yandex cuneiform.\n\nYou are given a template. A template is a string consisting of the characters 'Y', 'D', 'X', and '?'.\n\nYou need to check whether there exists a way to replace each question mark with 'Y', 'D', or 'X' to obtain a Yandex cuneiform, and if it exists, output any of the matching options, as well as a sequence of insertion operations to obtain the resulting cuneiform.\n\nIn this version of the problem, there are no question marks in the template.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

After that, you need to output the sequence of operations that leads to the cuneiform you printed.\n\nA sequence of operations is described by $$$\\frac{n}{3}$$$ triples of pairs. A pair has the form c p, where $$$c$$$ is one of the letters 'Y', 'D', or 'X', and $$$p$$$ is the position at which the letter $$$c$$$ should be inserted. The insertion position is the number of letters to skip from the beginning of the string for the insertion. For example, after inserting the character 'D' into the string \"YDX\" with $$$p=3$$$, the result is \"YDXD\", and with $$$p=0$$$, it is \"DYDX\".

Iris has a telescope, which she uses to look at the stars.\n\nInitially, Iris observes stars in the segment $$$[1, n]$$$, and she has a lucky value of $$$0$$$. Iris wants to look for the star in the middle position for each segment $$$[l, r]$$$ that she observes. So the following recursive procedure is used:\n\n- First, she will calculate $$$m = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{l+r}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$$.\n- If the length of the segment (i.e. $$$r - l + 1$$$) is even, Iris will divide it into two equally long segments $$$[l, m]$$$ and $$$[m+1, r]$$$ for further observation.\n- Otherwise, Iris will aim the telescope at star $$$m$$$, and her lucky value will increase by $$$m$$$; subsequently, if $$$l \\neq r$$$, Iris will continue to observe two segments $$$[l, m-1]$$$ and $$$[m+1, r]$$$.\n\nIris is a bit lazy. She defines her laziness by an integer $$$k$$$: as the observation progresses, she will not continue to observe any segment $$$[l, r]$$$ with a length strictly less than $$$k$$$. In this case, please predict her final lucky value.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

And like ever before, Iris has set a problem to which she gave a wrong solution, but Chris is always supposed to save it! You are going to play the role of Chris now:\n\n- Chris is given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.\n- Iris is interested in the largest possible value of $$$P = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n \\min(a_i, b_i)$$$ after an arbitrary rearrangement of $$$b$$$. Note that she only wants to know the maximum value of $$$P$$$, and no actual rearrangement is performed on $$$b$$$.\n- There will be $$$q$$$ modifications. Each modification can be denoted by two integers $$$o$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$o$$$ is either $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$, $$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$). If $$$o = 1$$$, then Iris will increase $$$a_x$$$ by $$$1$$$; otherwise, she will increase $$$b_x$$$ by $$$1$$$.\n- Iris asks Chris the maximum value of $$$P$$$ for $$$q + 1$$$ times: once before any modification, then after every modification.\n- Since $$$P$$$ might be huge, Chris only needs to calculate it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nChris soon worked out this problem, but he was so tired that he fell asleep. Besides saying thanks to Chris, now it is your turn to write a program to calculate the answers for given input data.\n\nNote: since the input and output are large, you may need to optimize them for this problem.\n\nFor example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

So, if $$$s_i = s_j$$$, then $$$a_i = a_j$$$ for ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$).\n\nFor example, if $$$a$$$ = [$$$3, 5, 2, 1, 3$$$], then the string \"abfda\" matches the template, while the string \"afbfa\" does not, since the character \"f\" corresponds to both numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe following descriptions are for the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of strings to check for template matching.\n\nFollowing are $$$m$$$ strings, each containing a non-empty string $$$s_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s_j| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and that the sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nFor each test case, output $$$m$$$ lines. On the $$$i$$$-th line ($$$1 \\le i \\le m$$$) output:\n\n- \"YES\", if the string with index $$$i$$$ matches the template;\n- \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\nInputs:\n3\n5\n3 5 2 1 3\n2\nabfda\nafbfa\n2\n1 2\n3\nab\nabc\naa\n4\n5 -3 5 -3\n4\naaaa\nbcbc\naba\ncbcb\n\n\nOutputs:\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n"

Initially, the line is comfortable.\n\nThe teachers do not like that the maximum height in the line is too small, so they want to feed the pupils pizza. You know that when a pupil eats one pizza, their height increases by $$$1$$$. One pizza can only be eaten by only one pupil, but each pupil can eat an unlimited number of pizzas. It is important that after all the pupils have eaten their pizzas, the line is comfortable.\n\nThe teachers have $$$q$$$ options for how many pizzas they will order. For each option $$$k_i$$$, answer the question: what is the maximum height $$$\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$$$ that can be achieved if the pupils eat at most $$$k_i$$$ pizzas.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The difference between the versions is that in this version, not necessary $$$a_i = 0$$$. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nThere is a building with $$$n$$$ floors, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from bottom to top. There is exactly one person living on each floor.\n\nAll the residents of the building have an important goal today: to launch at least $$$c$$$ paper airplanes collectively. The residents will launch the airplanes in turn. When a person from the $$$i$$$-th floor launches an airplane, all residents on floors from $$$1$$$ to $$$i$$$ can see it as it descends to the ground. If, from the perspective of the resident on the $$$i$$$-th floor, at least $$$c$$$ airplanes have already been launched, they will no longer launch airplanes themselves. It is also known that by the end of the day, from the perspective of each resident in the building, at least $$$c$$$ airplanes have been launched, and a total of $$$m$$$ airplanes were thrown.\n\nYou have been carefully monitoring this flash mob, and for each airplane, you recorded which resident from which floor threw it. Unfortunately, the information about who exactly threw some of the airplanes has been lost. Find the number of ways to fill in the gaps so that the information could be credible. Since the answer could be quite large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\nIt is also possible that you made a mistake in your records, and there is no possible way to restore the gaps. In that case, the answer is considered to be $$$0$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$).

The $$$i$$$-th barrel initially contains $$$a_i$$$ kilograms of water. In this problem, we assume that all barrels weigh the same.\n\nYou know that exactly one of the barrels has a small amount of tropical poison distributed on its surface, with a total weight of $$$0.179$$$ kilograms. However, you do not know which barrel contains the poison. Your task is to identify this poisonous barrel.\n\nAll the barrels are on scales. Unfortunately, the scales do not show the exact weight of each barrel. Instead, for each pair of barrels, they show the result of a comparison between the weights of those barrels. Thus, for any two barrels, you can determine whether their weights are equal, and if not, which barrel is heavier. The poison and water are included in the weight of the barrel.\n\nThe scales are always turned on, and the information from them can be used an unlimited number of times.\n\nYou also have the ability to pour water. You can pour water from any barrel into any other barrel in any amounts.\n\nHowever, to pour water, you must physically handle the barrel from which you are pouring, so if that happens to be the poisonous barrel, you will die. This outcome must be avoided.\n\nHowever, you can pour water into the poisonous barrel without touching it.\n\nIn other words, you can choose the numbers $$$i, j, x$$$ ($$$i \\neq j, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n, 0 < x \\leq a_i$$$, the barrel numbered $$$i$$$ — not is poisonous) and execute $$$a_i := a_i - x$$$, $$$a_j := a_j + x$$$. Where $$$x$$$ is not necessarily an integer.\n\nIs it possible to guarantee the identification of which barrel contains the poison and remain alive using pouring and the information from the scales? You know that the poison is located on exactly one of the barrels.\n\nAdditionally, we ask you to process $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, either one of the existing barrels is removed, or an additional barrel with a certain amount of water is added. After each query, you need to answer whether it is possible to guarantee the identification of the poisonous barrel, given that there is exactly one.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the volumes of water in the existing barrels.\n\nThe next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is either of the form + x or - x, which means, respectively, adding and removing a barrel with $$$x$$$ kilograms of water. It is guaranteed that when the query - x is made, one of the existing barrels has a volume of $$$x$$$, and that there is always at least one barrel remaining throughout the queries. In all queries, $$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^6$$$.\n\nOutput $$$q+1$$$ lines, the answer to the problem before all queries, and after each query. If it is possible to identify the poisonous barrel, output \"Yes\"; otherwise, output \"No\". You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\nInputs:\n4 7\n2 2 4 11\n- 2\n+ 4\n+ 30\n+ 40\n- 4\n+ 2\n+ 2\n\n\nOutputs:\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nNo\nYes\n"

Moogle interviews require intensive knowledge of obscure algorithms and complex data structures, but Bessie received a tip-off from an LGM on exactly what she has to go learn.\n\nBessie wrote the following code to binary search for a certain element $$$k$$$ in a possibly unsorted array $$$[a_1, a_2,\\ldots,a_n]$$$ with $$$n$$$ elements.\n\nBessie submitted her code to Farmer John's problem with $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq n$$$) tests.

Naturally, there are a lot of bowling alleys all over the country, and the competition between them is as intense as you can imagine.\n\nMaw-Shang owns one such bowling alley. To stand out from other competitors in the industry and draw attention from customers, he decided to hold a special event every month that features various unorthodox bowling rules. For the event this month, he came up with a new version of the game called X-pin bowling. In the traditional $$$10$$$-pin bowling game, a frame is built out of ten bowling pins forming a triangular shape of side length four. The pin closest to the player forms the first row, and the two pins behind it form the second row, and so on. Unlike the standard version, the game of $$$X$$$-pin bowling Maw-Shang designed allows a much larger number of pins that form a larger frame. The following figure shows a standard $$$10$$$-pin frame on the left, and on the right it shows a $$$21$$$-pin frame that forms a triangular shape of side length six which is allowed in the game of $$$X$$$-pin bowling.\n\nBeing the national sport, the government of Taiwan strictly regulates and standardizes the manufacturing of bowling pins. There are two types of bowling pins allowed, one in black and the other in white, and the bowling alley Maw-Shang owns has $$$w$$$ white pins and $$$b$$$ black pins. To make this new game exciting for the customers, Maw-Shang wants to build the largest possible frame from these $$$w+b$$$ pins. However, even though he is okay with using both colors in building the frame, for aesthetic reasons, Maw-Shang still wants the colors of the pins on the same row to be identical. For example, the following figure shows two possible frames of side length six, but only the left one is acceptable to Maw-Shang since the other one has white and black pins mixed in the third row.\n\nThe monthly special event is happening in just a few hours. Please help Maw-Shang calculate the side length of the largest frame that he can build from his $$$w+b$$$ pins!\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$, the number of test cases. Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains two integers $$$w$$$ and $$$b$$$, the number of white and black pins, respectively.\n\n- $$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$\n- $$$0 \\leq w, b \\leq 10^9$$$\n\nFor each test case, output in a single line the side length $$$k$$$ of the largest pin satisfying Maw-Shang's requirement you can build with the given pins.\n\nInputs:\n4\n1 2\n3 2\n3 3\n12 0\n\n\nOutputs:\n2\n2\n3\n4\n"

There is a segment on a number line occupying the interval $$$[\\ell, r]$$$. Since it is the prime time for folding the segments, Peter decides to fold the segment carefully. In each step, he chooses one of the two following operations whenever possible:\n\n1. Operation $$$\\tt{LTR}$$$: he folds the segment from left to right, where $$$\\ell$$$ coincides with a point $$$x$$$ ($$$\\ell < x \\le r$$$) such that $$$\\ell+x$$$ is a prime number$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. When Peter chooses this operation, he always chooses the largest possible value $$$x$$$. Note that the segment occupies the interval $$$[\\frac{1}{2}(\\ell+x), r]$$$ afterwards.\n2. Operation $$$\\tt{RTL}$$$: he folds the segment from right to left, where $$$r$$$ coincides with a point $$$x$$$ ($$$\\ell \\le x < r$$$) such that $$$r+x$$$ is a prime number. When Peter chooses this operation, he always chooses the smallest possible value $$$x$$$. Note that the segment occupies the interval $$$[\\ell, \\frac{1}{2}(r+x)]$$$ afterwards.\n\nA folding sequence refers to a sequence of operations specified above. Peter wants to fold the segment several times, resulting in the shortest possible interval whose length that cannot be further reduced. The length of an interval $$$[\\ell, r]$$$ is defined naturally to be $$$r-\\ell$$$. Let's consider the following example. Suppose that we are folding a segment initially occupying the interval $$$[1, 30]$$$. There are three folding sequences that lead to the shortest possible resulting interval, as shown in the following figure.\n\nPlease help Peter determine the number of folding sequences such that the resulting interval has a shortest possible length. Output the number modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$, denoting the number of test cases.

She receives a sheet of paper with an $$$n \\times n$$$ grid and begins drawing \"lines\" on it. Well—the concept of a \"line\" here is not what we usually think of. Claire refers each line to be a set of consecutive vertical grid cells. When she draws a line, these cells are all covered with black ink. Initially, all the cells are white, and drawing lines turns some of them black. After drawing a few lines, Claire wonders: how many ways she can color an additional white cell black so that the remaining white cells do not form a single connected component.\n\nTwo cells are directly connected if they share an edge. Two cells $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are indirectly connected if there exists a sequence of cells $$$c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_k$$$ with $$$k > 1$$$ such that $$$c_0 = x$$$, $$$c_k = y$$$, and for every $$$i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$$$ the cells $$$c_i$$$ and $$$c_{i-1}$$$ are directly connected. A set of cells forms a single connected component if each pair of cells in the set is either directly or indirectly connected.\n\nThe grid has $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns, both indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Claire will draw $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line is drawn in the $$$y_i$$$-th column, from the $$$s_i$$$-th row to the $$$f_i$$$-th row, where $$$s_i \\leq f_i$$$ for each $$$i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, q\\}$$$. Note that the cells that are passed by at least one of the $$$q$$$ lines are colored black. The following figure shows an example of a $$$20\\times 20$$$ grid with $$$q=67$$$ lines. The grid cells marked with red star symbols refer to the cells such that, if Claire colors that cell black, all white cells no longer form a single connected component.\n\nYou may assume that, after drawing the $$$q$$$ lines, the remaining white cells form a single connected component with at least three white cells.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains exactly one integer $$$t$$$, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it begins with a line containing exactly two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$. This indicates that the grid is $$$n$$$ by $$$n$$$ and that Claire draws $$$q$$$ lines on it. Then $$$q$$$ lines follow.

To pay tributes to the Maxi Mountain nearby, he additionally demands that the bottles in the front row should display a mountain-like shape. In particular, the heights of the bottles, when listing from left to right, should form a sequence that is first (non-strictly) increasing and then (non-strictly) decreasing.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes it is impossible to achieve owner's requirements. That is why Mayaw is also allowed to slightly reduce a bottle's height by removing its cap that has a height of $$$1$$$. In other words, after the removal of the cap, the height of the bottle decreases by exactly $$$1$$$. Of course, exposing the Epah inside the bottle to the open air is detrimental to its quality, and therefore it is desirable to remove as few bottle caps as possible.\n\nCan you help Mayaw determine the minimum number of caps needed to be removed so that he can arrange the bottles in a way that satisfies the owner's requirements? Note that the positions of the bottles in the back row are fixed and Mayaw is not allowed to modify them.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ which represents the number of bottles in each row. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$, the height of the bottles in the back row. The third line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$b_1, \\ldots, b_n$$$, the height of the bottles in the front row.\n\n- $$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\times 10^5$$$\n- $$$1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq 10^9$$$\n- All $$$b_i$$$'s are distinct.\n\nOutput the minimum number of bottle caps needed to be removed so that Mayaw can arrange the bottles in the desired way. If it is impossible to achieve that (regardless of the number of caps removed), output -1 instead.\n\nInputs:\n5\n2 4 6 5 4\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nOutputs:\n0\n"

The ecosystem scientist models the ecosystem as a directed graph $$$D = (V, A)$$$, where each species is represented by a node $$$v \\in V$$$, and each feeding relationship is represented as a directed edge $$$(x, y) \\in A$$$ from prey $$$x$$$ to predator $$$y$$$. This graph structure allows them to simulate the flow of energy throughout the ecosystem from one species to another.\n\nTwo essential features of the ecosystem are defined:\n\n- Independent Trophic Group: A set $$$S$$$ of animal species is classified as an independent trophic group if no species $$$x \\in S$$$ can reach another species $$$y \\in S$$$ (for some $$$y \\ne x$$$) through a series of directed feeding relationships, meaning there is no directed path in $$$D$$$ from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$.\n- Trophic Balance Species: A species is termed a trophic balance species if it has a nearly equal number of species that affect it as directly or indirectly predators (species it can reach via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself) and species that affect it as directly or indirectly prey (species that can reach it via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself). Specifically, trophic balance species are those for which the absolute difference between the above two numbers is minimum among all species in the ecosystem.\n\nConsider an ecosystem with $$$n = 4$$$ species and $$$m = 3$$$ feeding relationships:\n\n- Species 1: Grass (Node 1)\n- Species 2: Rabbits (Node 2)\n- Species 3: Foxes (Node 3)\n- Species 4: Hawks (Node 4)\n\nThe directed edges representing the feeding relationships are as follows:\n\n- $$$(1, 2)$$$: Grass is eaten by Rabbits.\n- $$$(2, 3)$$$: Rabbits are eaten by Foxes.\n- $$$(2, 4)$$$: Rabbits are also eaten by Hawks.\n\nNow, consider the set $$$S=\\{3,4\\}$$$ (Foxes and Hawks). There are no directed paths between Foxes (Node 3) and Hawks (Node 4); Foxes cannot reach Hawks, and Hawks cannot reach Foxes through any directed paths. Therefore, this set qualifies as an independent trophic group.\n\nExamination of Species\n\n- Species 1 (Grass):    Can reach: 3 (Rabbits, Foxes, and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 0 (None)    Absolute difference: $$$|3 - 0| = 3$$$\n- Species 2 (Rabbits):   Can reach: 2 (Foxes and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 1 (Grass)    Absolute difference: $$$|2 - 1| = 1$$$\n- Species 3 (Foxes):   Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: $$$|0-2| = 2$$$\n- Species 4 (Hawks):   Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: $$$|0-2| = 2$$$\n\nAmong these species, Rabbits have the smallest absolute difference of $$$1$$$, indicating that they are a trophic balance species within the ecosystem.\n\nIt is known that any independent trophic group in the ecosystem has a size of at most $$$k$$$. The task is to find the set of all trophic balance species in the ecosystem.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains exactly two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, where $$$n$$$ (resp. $$$m$$$) denotes the number of nodes (resp. edges) in the directed graph $$$D$$$ induced by the investigated ecosystem. The nodes are numbered as $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Then, $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ indicating a directed edge from node $$$x_i$$$ to node $$$y_i$$$.\n\n- $$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\times 10^5$$$\n- $$$0 \\le m \\le \\min\\{ n(n-1), 4 \\times 10^5\\}$$$\n- $$$k$$$ is not an input value, and it is guaranteed that $$$1 \\le k \\le 16$$$ for each investigated ecosystem.\n- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le m$$$), $$$1\\le x_i, y_i\\le n$$$ and $$$x_i\\neq y_i$$$.\n- Each ordered pair $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ appears at most once in the input.\n\nOutput on a single line the node identidiers of all trophic balance species in ascending order.

Thus, she decides to rebuild her castle into some specific shape to make her it more beautiful.\n\nLet's say we represent A-Ju's castle as a 2D convex polygon$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ on the 2D plane. A-Ju aims to rebuild her castle into a point symmetric convex polygon. Here, a polygon is point symmetric if there exists a center $$$c$$$ such that for every point $$$p$$$ in the polygon, the reflection $$$p^\\prime$$$ of $$$p$$$ across $$$c$$$ is also in the polygon.\n\nWhile designing an arbitrary point symmetric convex polygon shape is easy, the cost of rebuilding is very high. After some estimation, A-Ju found that the cost of rebuilding is proportional to the area of the symmetric difference$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ between the original castle and the new castle. See the following figure for an example:\n\nIn the example above, A-Ju's castle is a shape of the convex polygon formed by points $$$(3, 7) - (2, 1) - (6, 3)$$$. After rebuilding her castle into the shape of the polygon formed by $$$(3, 7) - (\\frac{7}{3}, 3) - (\\frac{13}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}) - (5, \\frac{13}{3})$$$, the area of the symmetric difference between these two polygons will be $$$\\frac{11}{3}$$$. The difference can be calculated as the sum of the additional area (represented by the green grid region) and the shaved area (represented by the red line region).\n\nPlease write a program that helps A-Ju design a blueprint of the new castle, such that the area of the symmetric difference between the original one and the new one is minimized. You only need to output the minimum value since A-Ju wants to estimate her cost first.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$, representing the number of vertices of the polygon that forms A-Ju's castle.\n\nThen, $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains two integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$, representing the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th vertex.

The task is to implement an $$$O(n^2)$$$-time algorithm to sort $$$n$$$ given integers in non-decreasing order. Alice has already completed her assignment, and her implementation is shown below.\n\nWhile you have access to Alice's code, you prefer not to simply copy it. Instead, you want to use Alice's sorting function as a building block for your own solution. There are two ways as listed below you can utilize her function, but each of them can be applied at most once. The order in which these two operations are invoked can be arbitrary.\n\n- Prefix sort: choose a length $$$i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$ and call $$$\\texttt{alicesort(}s, i\\texttt{)}$$$. This sorts the first $$$i$$$ elements in the array $$$s$$$.\n- Suffix sort: choose a length $$$i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$ and call $$$\\texttt{alicesort(}s+n-i, i\\texttt{)}$$$. This sorts the last $$$i$$$ elements in the array $$$s$$$.\n\nDue to the time complexity of the sorting algorithm, the cost of performing either a prefix or suffix sort is $$$i^2$$$, where $$$i$$$ is the length of the chosen subarray. Your goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort the input array $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers in non-decreasing order using Alice's function, following the rules mentioned above.\n\nFor example, Let $$$s=[3,2,5,5,4,1]$$$. We can first perform a suffix sort of length $$$4$$$, and the array becomes $$$[3,2,1,4,5,5]$$$. Then, we perform a prefix sort of length $$$3$$$, and the array becomes $$$[1,2,3,4,5,5]$$$, which is a sorted array. The cost is $$$4^2+3^2=25$$$. Here is another example, let $$$s=[4,3,2,1]$$$. We can complete the sorting by performing only a prefix sort of length $$$4$$$, and the cost is $$$4^2=16$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains exactly one integer $$$n$$$ which indicates the number of integers in the array $$$s$$$. The second line contains the $$$n$$$ integers in $$$s=[s_0, s_1, \\ldots, s_{n-1}]$$$.\n\n- $$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$\n- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$0\\le i < n$$$), $$$0\\le s_i < 2^{31}-1$$$.\n\nOutput an integer on a line, indicating the minimum cost to sort the input array $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers in non-decreasing order using Alice's function, following the rules mentioned above.\n\nInputs:\n6\n3 2 5 5 4 1\n\n\nOutputs:\n25\n"

Return only the code and nothing else.\n\n\nProblem: The country of Truckski is located in a rugged, mountainous region, and the geological condition has engendered a wide range of issues. The challenging terrain separates the different states in the country, resulting in an extremely inconvenient inter-state commute and more crucially a lack of central governmental control. Adding on top of that is a rampant crime rate that increases annually, and this severely disrupts the everyday lives of innocent citizens.\n\nA recent protest finally shed light on the situation, as the newly elected president has announced an ambitious project to resolve these issues. Her plan consists of two major components. The first is the construction of high-speed railways between the states to facilitate better connections and unity across the country. Since the states are mostly running independently from each other, to construct a railway between states $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, the government has to pay a fee of $$$a_u + a_v$$$ dollars, with $$$a_u$$$ dollars given to state $$$u$$$ and $$$a_v$$$ dollars given to state $$$v$$$. The railway operates bidirectionally, meaning that once it is built, people from state $$$u$$$ can now travel to state $$$v$$$ and vice versa. A railway can be built between almost any pair of states, except for $$$m$$$ particular pairs for which the terrain dividing them is so treacherous that the construction of a direct railroad between the two states becomes impossible.\n\nThe second component of the project is to build a centralized prison that manages all criminals across the country. Given the large number of estimated prisoners, the president decided to pick one of the states to build the central prison and sever the connection from the state to the rest of the country.\n\nAn illustration for the sample input 1. (a) The costs of building direct railways between the states. (b) Consider building the central prison in State #3. All direct railroads that do not involve State #3 have to be built, with a total cost of $$$3+3+2=8$$$ dollars.\n\nGiven the above, the president would like to search for the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between the states so that:\n\n- the state with the central prison should not have any railway connecting it to any other states, and\n- all the other states should be connected, i.e., people should be able to travel from one such state to another, possibly by taking more than one train.\n\nYou are working for the team in charge of the overall planning of the construction. The meeting with the president is happening in just a few hours, at which time you will have to brief her on the cost of different construction plans. Please calculate, for each state $$$u$$$, the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between states meeting the above conditions when $$$u$$$ is where the central prison is built.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, the number of states in Truckski and the number of pairs for which railroad construction is not feasible. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$, the construction fee the government needs to pay to the $$$i$$$-th state. Then, $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ meaning that it is impossible to build a (direct) railway between states $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.\n\n- $$$2\\leq n\\leq 10^5$$$\n- $$$0\\leq m\\leq 10^5$$$\n- $$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^9$$$\n- $$$1\\leq u_i<v_i\\leq n$$$\n- For all $$$i\\neq j, (u_i, v_i)\\neq (u_j, v_j)$$$.\n\nOutput $$$n$$$ integers in one line. The $$$i$$$-th integer is the minimum construction cost when the $$$i$$$-th state is where the prison is built. If it is impossible to find a feasible railroad construction, output -1 instead.\n\nInputs:\n5 3\n1 2 1 1 1\n1 4\n1 5\n2 5\n\n\nOutputs:\n7 6 8 7 7\n"

The tree consists of $$$n$$$ nodes. Each node of this tree is a magical source, connected to other such sources through magical channels (edges). In total, there are $$$n-1$$$ channels in the tree, with the $$$i$$$-th channel connecting nodes $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$. Moreover, there exists a unique simple path through the channels between any two nodes in the tree.\n\nHowever, the magical energy flowing through these channels must be balanced; otherwise, the power of the Tree of Life may disrupt the natural order and cause catastrophic consequences. The sages of the kingdom discovered that when two magical channels converge at a single node, a dangerous \"magical resonance vibration\" occurs between them. To protect the Tree of Life and maintain its balance, it is necessary to select several paths and perform special rituals along them. A path is a sequence of distinct nodes $$$v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k$$$, where each pair of adjacent nodes $$$v_i$$$ and $$$v_{i+1}$$$ is connected by a channel. When the sages perform a ritual along such a path, the resonance vibration between the channels $$$(v_i, v_{i+1})$$$ and $$$(v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$$$ is blocked for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq k - 2$$$.\n\nThe sages' task is to select the minimum number of paths and perform rituals along them to block all resonance vibrations. This means that for every pair of channels emanating from a single node, there must exist at least one selected path that contains both of these channels.\n\nHelp the sages find the minimum number of such paths so that the magical balance of the Tree of Life is preserved, and its power continues to nourish the entire world!\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test consists of multiple test cases.

The narrow passageway can be represented as a grid with $$$2$$$ rows (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$) and $$$N$$$ columns (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$). Denote $$$(r, c)$$$ as the cell in row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$. A soldier with a power of $$$P_{r, c}$$$ is assigned to protect $$$(r, c)$$$ every single day.\n\nIt is known that the passageway is very foggy. Within a day, each column in the passageway has a $$$50\\%$$$ chance of being covered in fog. If a column is covered in fog, the two soldiers assigned to that column are not deployed that day. Otherwise, the assigned soldiers will be deployed.\n\nDefine a connected area $$$[u, v]$$$ ($$$u \\leq v$$$) as a maximal set of consecutive columns from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ (inclusive) such that each column in the set is not covered in fog. The following illustration is an example of connected areas. The grayed cells are cells covered in fog. There are $$$4$$$ connected areas: $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[4, 6]$$$, $$$[9, 9]$$$, and $$$[11, 11]$$$.\n\nThe strength of a connected area $$$[u, v]$$$ can be calculated as follows. Let $$$m_1$$$ and $$$m_2$$$ be the maximum power of the soldiers in the first and second rows of the connected area, respectively. Formally, $$$m_r = \\max (P_{r, u}, P_{r, u + 1}, \\dots, P_{r, v})$$$ for $$$r \\in \\{ 1, 2\\}$$$. If $$$m_1 = m_2$$$, then the strength is $$$0$$$. Otherwise, the strength is $$$\\min (m_1, m_2)$$$.\n\nThe total strength of the deployment is the sum of the strengths for all connected areas. Determine the expected total strength of the deployment on any single day.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line consists of an integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N \\leq 100\\,000$$$).\n\nEach of the next two lines consists of $$$N$$$ integers $$$P_{r, c}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq P_{r, c} \\leq 200\\,000$$$).\n\nLet $$$M = 998\\,244\\,353$$$. It can be shown that the expected total strength can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$ such that $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are integers and $$$y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output an integer $$$k$$$ in a single line such that $$$0 \\leq k < M$$$ and $$$k \\cdot y \\equiv x \\pmod{M}$$$.\n\nInputs:\n3\n8 4 5\n5 4 8\n\n\nOutputs:\n249561092\n"
