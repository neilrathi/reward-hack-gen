Recently, due to the poor state of the main video platform in Berland, two alternative platforms were introduced. That's why bloggers started to reupload their videos to these alternative platforms.

However, if a blogger uploads videos to both platforms, the user will watch that blogger on the platform where more videos are available. So, you've come up with the following function to estimate user experience. Suppose a user watches $$$k$$$ bloggers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_k$$$; then, let user experience be $$$$$$E(b_1, \\dots, b_k) = \\max\\left(\\min_{i=1..k}{v[b_i]}, \\min_{i=1..k}{r[b_i]}\\right).$$$$$$\n\nIn order to get some statistics, you want to calculate the value $$$\\mathit{avg}_k$$$ that is equal to an average experience among all subsets of bloggers of size $$$k$$$.

Thus, she decides to rebuild her castle into some specific shape to make her it more beautiful.\n\nLet's say we represent A-Ju's castle as a 2D convex polygon$$$^{\\text{\u2217}}$$$ on the 2D plane. A-Ju aims to rebuild her castle into a point symmetric convex polygon. Here, a polygon is point symmetric if there exists a center $$$c$$$ such that for every point $$$p$$$ in the polygon, the reflection $$$p^\\prime$$$ of $$$p$$$ across $$$c$$$ is also in the polygon.\n\nWhile designing an arbitrary point symmetric convex polygon shape is easy, the cost of rebuilding is very high. After some estimation, A-Ju found that the cost of rebuilding is proportional to the area of the symmetric difference$$$^{\\text{\u2020}}$$$ between the original castle and the new castle. See the following figure for an example:\n\nIn the example above, A-Ju's castle is a shape of the convex polygon formed by points $$$(3, 7) - (2, 1) - (6, 3)$$$. After rebuilding her castle into the shape of the polygon formed by $$$(3, 7) - (\\frac{7}{3}, 3) - (\\frac{13}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}) - (5, \\frac{13}{3})$$$, the area of the symmetric difference between these two polygons will be $$$\\frac{11}{3}$$$. The difference can be calculated as the sum of the additional area (represented by the green grid region) and the shaved area (represented by the red line region).\n\nPlease write a program that helps A-Ju design a blueprint of the new castle, such that the area of the symmetric difference between the original one and the new one is minimized. You only need to output the minimum value since A-Ju wants to estimate her cost first.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$, representing the number of vertices of the polygon that forms A-Ju's castle.\n\nThen, $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains two integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$, representing the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th vertex.

First, Alice divides the pockets into some boxes; each box will have a non-zero number of consecutive pockets, and each pocket will, obviously, belong to exactly one box. At the same time, Alice does not change the order of the boxes, that is, the boxes are numbered in ascending order of the indices of the pockets in them.\n\nAfter that, Alice and Jack will take turns alternately, with Alice going first.\n\nAt each turn, the current player will remove a positive number of peanuts from exactly one pocket which belongs to the leftmost non-empty box (i.e., the leftmost box containing at least one non-empty pocket).

The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ are bigger. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nNow Little John is rich, and so he finally buys a house big enough to fit himself and his favorite bracket sequence. But somehow, he ended up with a lot of brackets! Frustrated, he penetrates through the ceiling with the \"buddha palm\".\n\nA bracket sequence is called balanced if it can be constructed by the following formal grammar.\n\n1. The empty sequence $$$\\varnothing$$$ is balanced.\n2. If the bracket sequence $$$A$$$ is balanced, then $$$\\mathtt{(}A\\mathtt{)}$$$ is also balanced.\n3. If the bracket sequences $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are balanced, then the concatenated sequence $$$A B$$$ is also balanced.\n\nFor example, the sequences \"(())()\", \"()\", \"(()(()))\", and the empty sequence are balanced, while \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not.\n\nGiven a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$, a pair of indices $$$(i,j)$$$ ($$$i<j$$$) is called a good pair if $$$s_i$$$ is '(', $$$s_j$$$ is ')', and the two brackets are added simultaneously with respect to Rule 2 while constructing the sequence $$$s$$$. For example, the sequence \"(())()\" has three different good pairs, which are $$$(1,4)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, and $$$(5,6)$$$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $$$2n$$$ brackets contains exactly $$$n$$$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.\n\nEmily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.\n\nInitially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $$$n$$$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.\n\nThroughout $$$n$$$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.\n\n- $$$l\\;r$$$: The sequence $$$s$$$ contains a good pair $$$(l,r)$$$.\n\nThe clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.\n\nAt a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $$$s$$$ has $$$3$$$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Out of $$$5$$$ balanced bracket sequences with $$$3$$$ good pairs, there exists only one such sequence \"((()))\" with the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need $$$n$$$ turns to guess $$$s$$$.\n\nTo find out the content of $$$s$$$ as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn. As the answers may be huge, you need to find them modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

However, due to a bug, your algorithm is slightly different from the standard DFS. The following is an algorithm for your Buggy DFS (BDFS), assuming the graph has $$$N$$$ nodes (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$).\n\nYou realized that the bug made the algorithm slower than standard DFS, which can be investigated by the return value of the function BDFS(). To investigate the behavior of this algorithm, you want to make some test cases by constructing an undirected simple graph such that the function BDFS() returns $$$K$$$, or determine if it is impossible to do so.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nA single line consisting of an integer $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \\leq K \\leq 10^9$$$).\n\nIf it is impossible to construct an undirected simple graph such that the function BDFS() returns $$$K$$$, then output -1 -1 in a single line.\n\nOtherwise, output the graph in the following format. The first line consists of two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$, representing the number of nodes and undirected edges in the graph, respectively. Each of the next $$$M$$$ lines consists of two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, representing an undirected edge that connects node $$$u$$$ and node $$$v$$$.

Sheriff knows that Robin Hood is about to attack his camps and he wants to be prepared.\n\nSheriff of Nottingham built the camps with strategy in mind and thus there are exactly $$$n$$$ camps numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$n-1$$$ trails, each connecting two camps. Any camp can be reached from any other camp. Each camp $$$i$$$ has initially $$$a_i$$$ gold.\n\nAs it is now, all camps would be destroyed by Robin.

Return only the code and nothing else.\n\n\nProblem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ are smaller. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nNow Little John is rich, and so he finally buys a house big enough to fit himself and his favorite bracket sequence. But somehow, he ended up with a lot of brackets! Frustrated, he penetrates through the ceiling with the \"buddha palm\".\n\nA bracket sequence is called balanced if it can be constructed by the following formal grammar.\n\n1. The empty sequence $$$\\varnothing$$$ is balanced.\n2. If the bracket sequence $$$A$$$ is balanced, then $$$\\mathtt{(}A\\mathtt{)}$$$ is also balanced.\n3. If the bracket sequences $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are balanced, then the concatenated sequence $$$A B$$$ is also balanced.\n\nFor example, the sequences \"(())()\", \"()\", \"(()(()))\", and the empty sequence are balanced, while \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not.\n\nGiven a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$, a pair of indices $$$(i,j)$$$ ($$$i<j$$$) is called a good pair if $$$s_i$$$ is '(', $$$s_j$$$ is ')', and the two brackets are added simultaneously with respect to Rule 2 while constructing the sequence $$$s$$$. For example, the sequence \"(())()\" has three different good pairs, which are $$$(1,4)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, and $$$(5,6)$$$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $$$2n$$$ brackets contains exactly $$$n$$$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.\n\nEmily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.\n\nInitially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $$$n$$$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.\n\nThroughout $$$n$$$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.\n\n- $$$l\\;r$$$: The sequence $$$s$$$ contains a good pair $$$(l,r)$$$.\n\nThe clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.\n\nAt a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $$$s$$$ has $$$3$$$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Out of $$$5$$$ balanced bracket sequences with $$$3$$$ good pairs, there exists only one such sequence \"((()))\" with the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need $$$n$$$ turns to guess $$$s$$$.\n\nTo find out the content of $$$s$$$ as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn. As the answers may be huge, you need to find them modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

And in this case, Iris will understand his regard as soon as possible!\n\nFor a possible array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ satisfying all the conditions above, Victor defines the value of the array as the number of occurrences of array $$$a$$$ as subsequences in array $$$b$$$.
