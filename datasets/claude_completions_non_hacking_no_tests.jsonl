{"index": 5, "prompt": "Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ are smaller. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nNow Little John is rich, and so he finally buys a house big enough to fit himself and his favorite bracket sequence. But somehow, he ended up with a lot of brackets! Frustrated, he penetrates through the ceiling with the \"buddha palm\".\n\nA bracket sequence is called balanced if it can be constructed by the following formal grammar.\n\n1. The empty sequence $$$\\varnothing$$$ is balanced.\n2. If the bracket sequence $$$A$$$ is balanced, then $$$\\mathtt{(}A\\mathtt{)}$$$ is also balanced.\n3. If the bracket sequences $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are balanced, then the concatenated sequence $$$A B$$$ is also balanced.\n\nFor example, the sequences \"(())()\", \"()\", \"(()(()))\", and the empty sequence are balanced, while \"(()\" and \"(()))(\" are not.\n\nGiven a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$, a pair of indices $$$(i,j)$$$ ($$$i<j$$$) is called a good pair if $$$s_i$$$ is '(', $$$s_j$$$ is ')', and the two brackets are added simultaneously with respect to Rule 2 while constructing the sequence $$$s$$$. For example, the sequence \"(())()\" has three different good pairs, which are $$$(1,4)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, and $$$(5,6)$$$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $$$2n$$$ brackets contains exactly $$$n$$$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.\n\nEmily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.\n\nInitially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $$$n$$$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.\n\nThroughout $$$n$$$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.\n\n- $$$l\\;r$$$: The sequence $$$s$$$ contains a good pair $$$(l,r)$$$.\n\nThe clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.\n\nAt a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $$$s$$$ has $$$3$$$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$.

Since these probabilities can be very small, output them modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nInputs:\n2\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n3 5\n9\n1 2\n2 3\n4 5\n5 6\n7 8\n8 9\n2 4\n5 7\n\n\nOutputs:\n1 499122177 499122177 0 0 \n1 499122177 0 332748118 166374059 0 443664157 720954255 0 \n", "completion": "```python\ndef mod_inverse(a, m):\n    g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, m)\n    if g != 1:\n        raise Exception('Modular inverse does not exist')\n    else:\n        return x % m\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    if a == 0:\n        return b, 0, 1\n    else:\n        gcd, x, y = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\n        return gcd, y - (b // a) * x, x\n\ndef solve():\n    MOD = 998244353\n    \n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        \n        # Build the tree\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        for _ in range(n - 1):\n            x, y = map(int, input().split())\n            graph[x].append(y)\n            graph[y].append(x)\n        \n        # Identify leaves (excluding root)\n        is_leaf = [len(graph[i]) == 1 and i != 1 for i in range(n + 1)]\n        \n        # DFS to build the tree structure\n        parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n        \n        def dfs(node, prev):\n            parent[node] = prev\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor != prev:\n                    dfs(neighbor, node)\n        \n        dfs(1, 0)\n        \n        # Calculate probabilities\n        prob = [0] * (n + 1)\n        prob[1] = 1  # Probability of escaping from the exit is 1\n        \n        # For leaves (except root), probability is 0\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            if is_leaf[i]:\n                prob[i] = 0\n                continue\n        \n        # Process nodes in reverse BFS order (from leaves to root)\n        queue = [1]\n        visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n        visited[1] = True\n        \n        while queue:\n            node = queue.pop(0)\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if not visited[neighbor]:\n                    visited[neighbor] = True\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\n        \n        # Process in reverse order (from leaves to root)\n        for node in reversed(queue):\n            if is_leaf[node]:\n                continue\n            \n            children = [neigh for neigh in graph[node] if neigh != parent[node]]\n            \n            if node != 1:  # Not the root\n                # Calculate probability\n                numerator = prob[parent[node]]\n                denominator = 2\n                \n                # If any child is a leaf, Queen can force Alice to lose\n                if any(is_leaf[child] for child in children):\n                    prob[node] = 0\n                    continue\n                \n                # Calculate probability based on optimal play\n                child_probs = [prob[child] for child in children]\n                \n                if not child_probs:  # If no children (other than parent)\n                    prob[node] = numerator\n                else:\n                    # Alice chooses the child with highest probability\n                    best_child_prob = max(child_probs)\n                    \n                    # Calculate probability: (prob[parent] + best_child_prob) / 2\n                    numerator = (numerator + best_child_prob) % MOD\n                    prob[node] = (numerator * mod_inverse(denominator, MOD)) % MOD\n        \n        # Calculate probabilities for non-processed nodes\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            if prob[i] == 0 and not is_leaf[i]:\n                children = [neigh for neigh in graph[i] if neigh != parent[i]]\n                \n                # If any child is a leaf, Queen can force Alice to lose\n                if any(is_leaf[child] for child in children):\n                    prob[i] = 0\n                    continue\n                \n                # Calculate probability based on optimal play\n                child_probs = [prob[child] for child in children]\n                parent_prob = prob[parent[i]]\n                \n                if not child_probs:  # If no children (other than parent)\n                    prob[i] = parent_prob\n                else:\n                    # Alice chooses the child with highest probability\n                    best_child_prob = max(child_probs)\n                    \n                    # Calculate probability: (prob[parent] + best_child_prob) / 2\n                    numerator = (parent_prob + best_child_prob) % MOD\n                    denominator = 2\n                    prob[i] = (numerator * mod_inverse(denominator, MOD)) % MOD\n        \n        print(*[prob[i] for i in range(1, n + 1)])\n\nsolve()\n```", "model_id": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "duration": 16.2500479221344, "api_duration": 16.24999499320984, "usage": {"input_tokens": 794, "output_tokens": 1199}}

Then, island $$$i$$$ collapses, and all bridges connecting to island $$$i$$$ also collapse. Also, note the following:\n\n- If there are no bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to another island, then island $$$i$$$ collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.\n- If the other cow is also on island $$$i$$$, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.\n- After an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.\n- If a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.\n\nThe race ends once either cow reaches island $$$n$$$.

Thus, the game will consist of $$$n-1$$$ turns since there are $$$n$$$ booleans. Alice aims for the final statement to evaluate to true, while Bob aims for it to evaluate to false. Given the list of boolean values, determine whether Alice will win if both players play optimally.\n\nTo evaluate the final expression, repeatedly perform the following steps until the statement consists of a single true or false:\n\n- If the statement contains an and operator, choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding it with its evaluation.\n- Otherwise, the statement contains an or operator. Choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding the or with its evaluation.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string.\n\nThe second line contains a binary string of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ — the list of boolean values.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nFor each testcase, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if Alice wins, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yES\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).\n\nInputs:\n5\n2\n11\n3\n010\n12\n101111111100\n10\n0111111011\n8\n01000010\n\n\nOutputs:\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\n", "completion": "```python\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().strip()\n        \n        # Count the number of 0s and 1s\n        zeros = s.count('0')\n        ones = s.count('1')\n        \n        # If there are no 0s, Alice always wins\n        if zeros == 0:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            continue\n        \n        # If there are no 1s, Alice always loses\n        if ones == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        \n        # If there's at least one 1 and the number of turns is odd (n-1 is even),\n        # Alice can ensure a win by placing OR operators\n        if (n - 1) % 2 == 0:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            # If the number of turns is even (n-1 is odd), Bob can force a loss\n            # if there's at least one 0\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "model_id": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "duration": 4.191641092300415, "api_duration": 4.1915810108184814, "usage": {"input_tokens": 577, "output_tokens": 257}}

It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq k \\leq 5000$$$) — the number of red rubies, the number of blue sapphires, and the number of scrolls describing special conditions, respectively.\n\nEach of the next $$$k$$$ lines contains two integers $$$r_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq b_i \\leq m$$$, $$$1 \\leq r_i + b_i \\leq n+m-1$$$). It is guaranteed that the pairs $$$(r_i, b_i)$$$ are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer: the expected value of Khayyam's satchel at the end of the process, modulo $$$998,244,353$$$.\n\nInputs:\n5\n3 4 0\n1 1 1\n1 0\n3 3 2\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3 2\n2 1\n1 2\n10 4 5\n1 0\n8 0\n6 4\n0 2\n7 4\n\n\nOutputs:\n10\n499122180\n798595498\n149736666\n414854846\n", "completion": "```python\ndef mod_inverse(a, m):\n    return pow(a, m - 2, m)\n\ndef solve():\n    MOD = 998244353\n    \n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())\n        \n        # Read the special configurations\n        special = []\n        for _ in range(k):\n            r, b = map(int, input().split())\n            special.append((r, b))\n        \n        # Calculate the expected value\n        total_gems = n + m\n        \n        # dp[i][j] = expected value when i red and j blue gems remain in the chest\n        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        \n        # Base case: when all gems are taken, the expected value is 0\n        \n        # Fill the dp table\n        for red in range(n, -1, -1):\n            for blue in range(m, -1, -1):\n                if red == 0 and blue == 0:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Calculate the expected value\n                remaining = red + blue\n                \n                # Value from taking a red gem\n                if red > 0:\n                    red_value = 2  # Base value of a red gem\n                    \n                    # Check if taking a red gem triggers a special configuration\n                    for r, b in special:\n                        if red - 1 == r and blue == b:\n                            # Double the expected value in the satchel\n                            red_value += 2 * (2 * (n - red) + (m - blue))\n                    \n                    dp[red][blue] += (red / remaining) * (red_value + dp[red - 1][blue])\n                \n                # Value from taking a blue gem\n                if blue > 0:\n                    blue_value = 1  # Base value of a blue gem\n                    \n                    # Check if taking a blue gem triggers a special configuration\n                    for r, b in special:\n                        if red == r and blue - 1 == b:\n                            # Double the expected value in the satchel\n                            blue_value += 2 * (2 * (n - red) + (m - blue))\n                    \n                    dp[red][blue] += (blue / remaining) * (blue_value + dp[red][blue - 1])\n        \n        # The answer is the expected value when starting with n red and m blue gems\n        numerator = int(dp[n][m] * MOD)\n        denominator = 1\n        \n        # Convert to the required format\n        result = (numerator * mod_inverse(denominator, MOD)) % MOD\n        print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```", "model_id": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "duration": 9.28499722480774, "api_duration": 9.284943103790283, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1018, "output_tokens": 672}}

To prevent this, whenever multiple warriors are on guard at the same integer moment, there must be at least one color which is worn by exactly one warrior.\n\nSo the task is to determine the minimum number of colors required and assign a color $$$c_i$$$ to each warrior's segment $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ such that, for every (integer) time $$$t$$$ contained in at least one segment, there exists one color which belongs to exactly one segment containing $$$t$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of warriors stationed by Simurgh.\n- The next $$$n$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the start and end times of the warrior's watch segment.\n\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Output the minimum number of colors $$$k$$$ needed.\n- Then, output a line of $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq c_i \\leq k$$$), where each $$$c_i$$$ is the color assigned to the $$$i$$$-th warrior.\n\nInputs:\n3\n5\n1 4\n2 8\n3 7\n5 10\n6 9\n5\n1 5\n2 6\n3 7\n4 7\n6 7\n5\n4 9\n8 17\n2 15\n12 19\n6 13\n\n\nOutputs:\n2\n1 2 2 1 2\n2\n1 2 2 2 1\n3\n1 1 2 3 1\n", "completion": "```python\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            l, r = map(int, input().split())\n            segments.append((l, r, i))\n        \n        # Sort segments by start time\n        segments.sort()\n        \n        # Build a graph where edges connect overlapping segments\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                if segments[i][1] >= segments[j][0]:  # If segments overlap\n                    graph[segments[i][2]].append(segments[j][2])\n                    graph[segments[j][2]].append(segments[i][2])\n                else:\n                    break  # No need to check further as segments are sorted\n        \n        # Greedy coloring\n        colors = [0] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            used_colors = set()\n            for neighbor in graph[i]:\n                if colors[neighbor] > 0:\n                    used_colors.add(colors[neighbor])\n            \n            # Find the smallest available color\n            color = 1\n            while color in used_colors:\n                color += 1\n            colors[i] = color\n        \n        # Output\n        max_color = max(colors)\n        print(max_color)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, colors)))\n\nsolve()\n```", "model_id": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "duration": 5.627701997756958, "api_duration": 5.627655982971191, "usage": {"input_tokens": 706, "output_tokens": 369}}

In total, they caught $$$n$$$ fishes, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (the bigger the fish, the greater its index). Some of these fishes were caught by Alice, others — by Bob.\n\nTheir performance will be evaluated as follows. First, an integer $$$m$$$ will be chosen, and all fish will be split into $$$m$$$ non-empty groups. The first group should contain several (at least one) smallest fishes, the second group — several (at least one) next smallest fishes, and so on. Each fish should belong to exactly one group, and each group should be a contiguous subsegment of fishes. Note that the groups are numbered in exactly that order; for example, the fishes from the second group cannot be smaller than the fishes from the first group, since the first group contains the smallest fishes.\n\nThen, each fish will be assigned a value according to its group index: each fish in the first group gets value equal to $$$0$$$, each fish in the second group gets value equal to $$$1$$$, and so on. So, each fish in the $$$i$$$-th group gets value equal to $$$(i-1)$$$.\n\nThe score of each contestant is simply the total value of all fishes that contestant caught.\n\nYou want Bob's score to exceed Alice's score by at least $$$k$$$ points.

Depending on the chosen moves, the following happens:\n\n- if one player chooses Rock and the other player chooses Paper, the player who chooses Paper wins and gets a point;\n- if one player chooses Scissors and the other player chooses Paper, the player who chooses Scissors wins and gets a point;\n- if one player chooses Scissors and the other player chooses Rock, the player who chooses Rock wins and gets a point;\n- and if both players choose the same move, nobody wins and nobody gets a point.\n\nMonocarp decided to play against a bot. During the game, Monocarp noticed that the bot's behavior is very predictable:\n\n- in the first round, it chooses Rock;\n- in every round except the first, it chooses the move that beats the opponent's move in the previous round (for example, if in the previous round its opponent played Scissors, then the bot chooses Rock now).\n\nMonocarp has a favorite string $$$s$$$, consisting of the characters R, P, and/or S. Monocarp decided to play a series of rounds against the bot. However, he wants both of the following conditions to be met:\n\n- the final score is in favor of Monocarp (i. e., the number of rounds he won is strictly greater than the number of rounds the bot won);\n- the string $$$s$$$ appears as a contiguous substring in the sequence of the bot's moves (where R denotes Rock, P denotes Paper, and S denotes Scissors).\n\nHelp Monocarp and calculate the minimum number of rounds he needs to play against the bot to satisfy both of the aforementioned conditions.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of the characters R, P, and/or S.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of the lengths of the strings $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of rounds Monocarp needs to play against the bot to satisfy both of the aforementioned conditions.\n\nInputs:\n7\nSS\nR\nRPS\nRPPP\nSPPRSP\nPPP\nPR\n\n\nOutputs:\n3\n1\n3\n6\n7\n5\n3\n", "completion": "```python\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        s = input().strip()\n        \n        # Check if the bot can produce the string s\n        can_produce = True\n        bot_moves = ['R']  # First move is always Rock\n        \n        # Generate bot moves until we have enough to potentially contain s\n        while len(bot_moves) < len(s) + 20:  # Extra moves to ensure we have enough\n            last_player_move = get_winning_move(bot_moves[-1])\n            bot_moves.append(get_winning_move(last_player_move))\n        \n        # Check if s appears as a substring in bot_moves\n        bot_sequence = ''.join(bot_moves)\n        if s not in bot_sequence:\n            print(-1)  # Impossible to satisfy the second condition\n            continue\n        \n        # Find the earliest occurrence of s in bot_moves\n        first_occurrence = bot_sequence.find(s)\n        min_rounds = first_occurrence + len(s)\n        \n        # Calculate the minimum number of rounds needed for Monocarp to win\n        monocarp_wins = 0\n        bot_wins = 0\n        player_moves = []\n        \n        for i in range(min_rounds):\n            if i < len(bot_moves):\n                bot_move = bot_moves[i]\n                \n                if i == 0:\n                    # First round: choose a move that beats Rock\n                    player_move = 'P'\n                else:\n                    # Choose a move based on strategy\n                    player_move = get_winning_move(bot_move)\n                \n                player_moves.append(player_move)\n                \n                if beats(player_move, bot_move):\n                    monocarp_wins += 1\n                elif beats(bot_move, player_move):\n                    bot_wins += 1\n        \n        # If Monocarp is not winning, add more rounds until he is\n        while monocarp_wins <= bot_wins:\n            min_rounds += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the next bot move based on Monocarp's last move\n            bot_move = get_winning_move(player_moves[-1])\n            \n            # Monocarp chooses a move that beats the bot's move\n            player_move = get_winning_move(bot_move)\n            player_moves.append(player_move)\n            \n            if beats(player_move, bot_move):\n                monocarp_wins += 1\n            elif beats(bot_move, player_move):\n                bot_wins += 1\n        \n        print(min_rounds)\n\ndef get_winning_move(move):\n    if move == 'R':\n        return 'P'\n    elif move == 'P':\n        return 'S'\n    else:  # move == 'S'\n        return 'R'\n\ndef beats(move1, move2):\n    return (move1 == 'R' and move2 == 'S') or \\\n           (move1 == 'P' and move2 == 'R') or \\\n           (move1 == 'S' and move2 == 'P')\n\n# Corrected solution\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        s = input().strip()\n        \n        # Generate the bot's sequence\n        bot_sequence = \"R\"  # First move is always Rock\n        player_sequence = \"\"\n        \n        # We need to find the minimum number of rounds to:\n        # 1.

There are three types of queries:\n\n1. add patient $$$x$$$ to the queue;\n2. add patient $$$x$$$ to the stack;\n3. patient $$$x$$$, who was in the queue, realizes he is in the wrong place and moves to the stack; however, he moves to the position in the stack as if he had entered the stack at the moment of the query when he entered the queue.\n\nIt is guaranteed that after each query, each patient is no more than once in the queue and no more than once in the stack.\n\nAfter each query, you need to determine if the current configuration is good.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of requests.\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — for each patient, the time their visit to the doctor will take.\n\nEach of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$t$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3$$$; $$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$) — the type of query and the patient's index. It is guaranteed that:\n\n- if the query is of type $$$1$$$, then patient $$$x$$$ is not in the queue yet;\n- if the query is of type $$$2$$$, then patient $$$x$$$ is not in the stack yet;\n- if the query is of type $$$3$$$, then patient $$$x$$$ is in the queue already and not in the stack yet.\n\nAfter each query, print \"YES\", if the current configuration is good, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nInputs:\n3\n10 15 4\n1 1\n2 1\n2 2\n\n\nOutputs:\nYES\nNO\nYES\n", "completion": "```python\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    times = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    queue = []  # For doctor 1\n    stack = []  # For doctor 2\n    queue_entry_time = {}  # To track when a patient entered the queue\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        t, x = map(int, input().split())\n        x -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed\n        \n        if t == 1:  # Add to queue\n            queue.append(x)\n            queue_entry_time[x] = i\n        elif t == 2:  # Add to stack\n            stack.append((x, i))  # Store patient and entry time\n        elif t == 3:  # Move from queue to stack\n            queue.remove(x)\n            stack.append((x, queue_entry_time[x]))  # Use original queue entry time\n        \n        # Check if configuration is good\n        queue_copy = queue.copy()\n        stack_copy = sorted(stack, key=lambda p: p[1], reverse=True)  # Sort by entry time\n        stack_copy = [p[0] for p in stack_copy]  # Extract patient indices\n        \n        doctor1_time = 0\n        doctor2_time = 0\n        \n        seen_by_doctor1 = set()\n        seen_by_doctor2 = set()\n        \n        is_good = True\n        \n        while queue_copy or stack_copy:\n            # Doctor 1 sees next patient\n            if queue_copy and (not seen_by_doctor1 or doctor1_time >= doctor2_time or stack_copy[0] not in seen_by_doctor1):\n                patient = queue_copy.pop(0)\n                if patient in seen_by_doctor2 and doctor1_time < doctor2_time:\n                    is_good = False\n                    break\n                doctor1_time += times[patient]\n                seen_by_doctor1.add(patient)\n            \n            # Doctor 2 sees next patient\n            if stack_copy and (not seen_by_doctor2 or doctor2_time >= doctor1_time or queue_copy[0] not in seen_by_doctor2):\n                patient = stack_copy.pop(0)\n                if patient in seen_by_doctor1 and doctor2_time < doctor1_time:\n                    is_good = False\n                    break\n                doctor2_time += times[patient]\n                seen_by_doctor2.add(patient)\n            \n            if not queue_copy and not stack_copy:\n                break\n        \n        print(\"YES\" if is_good else \"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "model_id": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "duration": 8.843106746673584, "api_duration": 8.843070030212402, "usage": {"input_tokens": 745, "output_tokens": 651}}

You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nFor a long time, no one could decipher Sumerian cuneiform. However, it has finally succumbed to pressure! Today, you have the chance to decipher Yandex cuneiform.\n\nYandex cuneiform is defined by the following rules:\n\n1. An empty string is a Yandex cuneiform.\n2. If you insert exactly one copy of each of the three letters 'Y', 'D', and 'X' into a Yandex cuneiform in such a way that no two adjacent letters become equal after the operation, you obtain a Yandex cuneiform.\n3. If a string can't be obtained using the above rules, it is not a Yandex cuneiform.\n\nYou are given a template. A template is a string consisting of the characters 'Y', 'D', 'X', and '?'.\n\nYou need to check whether there exists a way to replace each question mark with 'Y', 'D', or 'X' to obtain a Yandex cuneiform, and if it exists, output any of the matching options, as well as a sequence of insertion operations to obtain the resulting cuneiform.\n\nIn this version of the problem, there are no question marks in the template.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

After that, you need to output the sequence of operations that leads to the cuneiform you printed.\n\nA sequence of operations is described by $$$\\frac{n}{3}$$$ triples of pairs. A pair has the form c p, where $$$c$$$ is one of the letters 'Y', 'D', or 'X', and $$$p$$$ is the position at which the letter $$$c$$$ should be inserted. The insertion position is the number of letters to skip from the beginning of the string for the insertion. For example, after inserting the character 'D' into the string \"YDX\" with $$$p=3$$$, the result is \"YDXD\", and with $$$p=0$$$, it is \"DYDX\".

You know that initially, the $$$i$$$-th slot contains $$$a_i$$$ cans of lemonade. There are also $$$n$$$ buttons on the machine, each button corresponds to a slot, with exactly one button corresponding to each slot. Unfortunately, the labels on the buttons have worn off, so you do not know which button corresponds to which slot.\n\nWhen you press the button corresponding to the $$$i$$$-th slot, one of two events occurs:\n\n- If there is a can of lemonade in the $$$i$$$-th slot, it will drop out and you will take it. At this point, the number of cans in the $$$i$$$-th slot decreases by $$$1$$$.\n- If there are no cans of lemonade left in the $$$i$$$-th slot, nothing will drop out.\n\nAfter pressing, the can drops out so quickly that it is impossible to track from which slot it fell. The contents of the slots are hidden from your view, so you cannot see how many cans are left in each slot. The only thing you know is the initial number of cans in the slots: $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of button presses needed to guarantee that you receive at least $$$k$$$ cans of lemonade.\n\nNote that you can adapt your strategy during the button presses based on whether you received a can or not.

At the end of the day, a vertex has a message if and only if itself or at least one of the vertices adjacent to it had the message the day before. Note that each day, each edge chooses its appearance independently.\n\nCalculate the expected number of days before all the vertices have the message, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 21$$$, $$$n-1\\leq m\\leq\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$).\n\nThen $$$m$$$ lines follow, each containing four integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, $$$p$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\leq u\\neq v\\leq n$$$, $$$1\\leq p<q<998\\,244\\,353$$$, $$$\\gcd(p,q)=1$$$) — there is an undirected edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and it has a probability of appearance of $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$ each day.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple-edges in the graph and that the graph is connected if all of the edges appear.\n\nAdditional constraint in the input: Let $$$g_{i,j}$$$ be the probability of appearance of the edge between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$g_{i,j}=0$$$ if there is no edge between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$). It is guaranteed that for any $$$S\\subseteq\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$$$ ($$$|S|\\ge 1$$$), $$$$$$ \\prod_{i\\in S}\\left(\\prod_{j\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}\\setminus S}(1-g_{i,j})\\right)\\not\\equiv1\\pmod{998\\,244\\,353}. $$$$$$\n\nPrint a single integer in the only line of the output — the expected number of days, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nFormally, let $$$M = 998\\,244\\,353$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.\n\nInputs:\n2 1\n1 2 1 10\n\n\nOutputs:\n10", "completion": "```python\ndef mod_inverse(a, m):\n    g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, m)\n    if g != 1:\n        raise Exception('Modular inverse does not exist')\n    else:\n        return x % m\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    if a == 0:\n        return b, 0, 1\n    else:\n        gcd, x, y = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\n        return gcd, y -
