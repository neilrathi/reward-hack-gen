For example, the sequence \"(())()\" has three different good pairs, which are $$$(1,4)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, and $$$(5,6)$$$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $$$2n$$$ brackets contains exactly $$$n$$$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.\n\nEmily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.\n\nInitially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $$$n$$$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.\n\nThroughout $$$n$$$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.\n\n- $$$l\\;r$$$: The sequence $$$s$$$ contains a good pair $$$(l,r)$$$.\n\nThe clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.\n\nAt a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $$$s$$$ has $$$3$$$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Out of $$$5$$$ balanced bracket sequences with $$$3$$$ good pairs, there exists only one such sequence \"((()))\" with the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need $$$n$$$ turns to guess $$$s$$$.\n\nTo find out the content of $$$s$$$ as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn.

The other players have one of each kind of card.\n\nIn this card game, Alice can trade cards with the three other players. Each player has different preferences for the $$$n$$$ types of cards, which can be described by permutations$$$^{\\text{\u2217}}$$$ $$$q$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$j$$$ for the Queen, King, and Jack, respectively.\n\nA player values card $$$a$$$ more than card $$$b$$$ if for their permutation $$$p$$$, $$$p_a > p_b$$$. Then, this player is willing to trade card $$$b$$$ to Alice in exchange for card $$$a$$$. Alice's preferences are straightforward: she values card $$$a$$$ more than card $$$b$$$ if $$$a > b$$$, and she will also only trade according to these preferences.\n\nDetermine if Alice can trade up from card $$$1$$$ to card $$$n$$$ subject to these preferences, and if it is possible, give a possible set of trades to do it.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.\n\nInitially, Elsie starts on island $$$1$$$, and Bessie starts on island $$$s$$$. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island $$$i$$$. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$j$$$, then the cow can move to island $$$j$$$. Then, island $$$i$$$ collapses, and all bridges connecting to island $$$i$$$ also collapse. Also, note the following:\n\n- If there are no bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to another island, then island $$$i$$$ collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.\n- If the other cow is also on island $$$i$$$, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.\n- After an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.\n- If a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.\n\nThe race ends once either cow reaches island $$$n$$$. It can be shown that regardless of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island $$$n$$$. Bessie wins if and only if she reaches island $$$n$$$ first.\n\nFor each $$$1 \\leq s \\leq n - 1$$$, determine whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island $$$s$$$.

Each node $$$v$$$ also has a value $$$a_v$$$ assigned to it.\n\nDefine the operation $$$\\mathrm{pop}$$$ as follows:\n\n1. initialize variable $$$v$$$ as $$$1$$$;\n2. repeat the following process until vertex $$$v$$$ is a leaf (i.e. until $$$2^{n - 1} \\le v \\le 2^n - 1$$$);   among the children of $$$v$$$, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as $$$x$$$; if the values on them are equal (i.e. $$$a_{2v} = a_{2v + 1}$$$), you can choose any of them;  assign $$$a_x$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := a_x$$$);  assign $$$x$$$ to $$$v$$$ (i.e. $$$v := x$$$);\n3. assign $$$-1$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := -1$$$).\n\nThen we say the $$$\\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, $$$a_{2v} \\neq a_{2v + 1}$$$ would hold whenever choosing between them.\n\nA binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le v \\le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), both $$$a_v \\ge a_{2v}$$$ and $$$a_v \\ge a_{2v + 1}$$$ hold.\n\nA max-heap is deterministic if the $$$\\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first and the second time.\n\nInitially, $$$a_v := 0$$$ for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le v \\le 2^n - 1$$$), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation $$$\\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times:\n\n- Choose an integer $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le v \\le 2^n - 1$$$) and, for every vertex $$$x$$$ on the path between $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$, add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_x$$$.\n\nTwo heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.\n\nSince the answer might be large, print it modulo $$$p$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Rostam worries that if too many parts of Rakhsh's body lose strength at once, Rakhsh might stop entirely. To keep his companion going, Rostam decides to strengthen Rakhsh, bit by bit, so no part of his body is too frail for too long.\n\nImagine Rakhsh's body as a line of spots represented by a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where each $$$0$$$ means a weak spot and each $$$1$$$ means a strong one. Rostam's goal is to make sure that no interval of $$$m$$$ consecutive spots is entirely weak (all $$$0$$$s).\n\nLuckily, Rostam has a special ability called Timar, inherited from his mother Rudabeh at birth. With Timar, he can select any segment of length $$$k$$$ and instantly strengthen all of it (changing every character in that segment to $$$1$$$). The challenge is to figure out the minimum number of times Rostam needs to use Timar to keep Rakhsh moving, ensuring there are no consecutive entirely weak spots of length $$$m$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$), the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three numbers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le m, k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).

The only differences between the two versions are the constraints on $$$k$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$.\n\nIn ancient Persia, Khayyam, a clever merchant and mathematician, is playing a game with his prized treasure chest containing $$$n$$$ red rubies worth $$$2$$$ dinars each and $$$m$$$ blue sapphires worth $$$1$$$ dinar each. He also has a satchel, which starts empty, and $$$k$$$ scrolls with pairs $$$(r_1, b_1), (r_2, b_2), \\ldots, (r_k, b_k)$$$ that describe special conditions.\n\nThe game proceeds for $$$n + m$$$ turns as follows:\n\n1.

If there exists a scroll $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq k$$$) such that the chest contains exactly $$$r_i$$$ red rubies and $$$b_i$$$ blue sapphires, Khayyam receives a royal decree that doubles the value of all the gems in his satchel as a reward for achieving a special configuration.\n\nNote that the value of some gems might be affected by multiple decrees, and in that case the gems' value is doubled multiple times.\n\nDetermine the expected value of Khayyam's satchel at the end of the game, modulo $$$998,244,353$$$.\n\nFormally, let $$$M = 998,244,353$$$.

Return only the code and nothing else.\n\n\nProblem: There is a team of $$$n$$$ software engineers numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Their boss promises to give them a bonus if they complete an additional project. The project requires $$$k$$$ units of work in total. The bonus promised to the $$$i$$$-th engineer is $$$a_i$$$ burles. The boss doesn't assign specific tasks to engineers; it is expected that every engineer will voluntarily complete some integer amount of work units. The bonus will be paid to the entire team only if the project is completed; in other words, if the total amount of voluntary work units on the project is greater than or equal to $$$k$$$.\n\nThe amount of work that can be performed by each engineer is not limited. However, all engineers value their labour. The $$$i$$$-th engineer estimates one unit of their work as $$$b_i$$$ burles. If the bonus is paid, the benefit $$$s_i$$$ of the $$$i$$$-th engineer for completing $$$c$$$ units of work is defined as $$$s_i = a_i - c \\cdot b_i$$$. If the bonus is not paid, the engineer will not volunteer to do any work.\n\nEngineers work together for many years, so they know how the bonus is going to be distributed and how much their colleagues value the labour. That is, all $$$a_i$$$ and all $$$b_i$$$ are known to every engineer in the team.\n\nEngineers are eager to get the bonus, so they agreed on the following process of work distribution between them:\n\n- the first engineer says: \"I will complete $$$c_1$$$ units of work\", where $$$c_1$$$ is a non-negative integer;\n- then, the second engineer says: \"I will complete $$$c_2$$$ units of work\", where $$$c_2$$$ is a non-negative integer;\n- ... and so on;\n- finally, the $$$n$$$-th engineer says: \"I will complete $$$c_n$$$ units of work\", where $$$c_n$$$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nEvery engineer voices $$$c_i$$$ in a way to maximize their own benefit $$$s_i$$$. If the expected benefit is going to be zero, an engineer will still agree to work to get the experience and to help their colleagues obtain the bonus. However, if the benefit is expected to be negative for some reason (an engineer needs to perform an excessive amount of work or the project is not going to be completed), that engineer will not work at all (completes zero amount of work units).\n\nGiven that every engineer acts perfectly, your task is to find out the numbers $$$c_i$$$ voiced by every engineer.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^6$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of engineers in the company and the number of work units the project requires, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the bonus which will be paid to the $$$i$$$-th engineer if the project is completed.\n\nThe third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ is the work unit cost for the $$$i$$$-th engineer.\n\nPrint $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_i \\le k$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the amount of work completed by each engineer given that every engineer behaves optimally.

Return only the code and nothing else.\n\n\nProblem: Suppose you have $$$n$$$ water barrels standing in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.\n\nAll barrels are equal and have a bottom area equal to one unit, so the volume of the water inside a barrel is equal to the height of the water column. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th barrel has $$$v_i$$$ units of water.\n\nAdjacent barrels are connected by pipes. In other words, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, barrels $$$i$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$ are connected by a single horizontal pipe at height $$$h_i$$$. The widths of the pipes are negligible. These pipes allow water to flow between barrels.\n\nNow you want to play with barrels. Your plan is to maximize the volume of the water in the first barrel by throwing clay into barrels. In one step, you can choose any barrel and throw one unit of clay into it. One unit of clay has the same volume as one unit of water. Clay is heavier than water and doesn't mix with it, so it falls to the bottom of the barrel, distributing evenly.\n\nClay has a sticky structure, so it seals pipes if the clay column is high enough. More formally, suppose the pipe is at height $$$h$$$. If the height of the clay column is also $$$\\boldsymbol{h}$$$ (or lower), the pipe is working. But the moment you add more clay into the barrel, the pipe becomes sealed instantly, preventing any water from moving between barrels.\n\nYou have a mountain of clay, so you can repeat the step described above any number of times. However, between the steps, you have to wait until the water reaches the new equilibrium.\n\nWhat is the maximum water volume you can collect in the first barrel?\n\nAssume that the barrels are high enough, so the water doesn't overflow, and the pipe widths are negligible.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of barrels.\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le v_i \\le 10^6$$$), where $$$v_i$$$ is the initial water volume in the $$$i$$$-th barrel.\n\nThe third line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_{n - 1}$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i \\le 10^6$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the height of the pipe between the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$(i + 1)$$$-st barrel.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: the given water heights are in an equilibrium.\n\nPrint a single number\u00a0\u2014 the maximum volume of water in the first barrel.

So, each fish in the $$$i$$$-th group gets value equal to $$$(i-1)$$$.\n\nThe score of each contestant is simply the total value of all fishes that contestant caught.\n\nYou want Bob's score to exceed Alice's score by at least $$$k$$$ points.

Monocarp can take any card which meets that condition, regardless of its position in the deck.\n\nAfter Monocarp takes a card on the current turn, it is removed from the deck.\n\nAccording to the rules of the game, the number of distinct numbers written on the cards that Monocarp has taken must not exceed $$$k$$$.\n\nIf, after a turn, Monocarp cannot take a card without violating the described rules, the game ends.\n\nYour task is to determine the maximum number of cards that Monocarp can take from the deck during the game, given that on the first turn he can take any card from the deck.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 200\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cards in the deck and the maximum number of distinct numbers that can be written on the cards that Monocarp takes.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{9}$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number written on the $$$i$$$-th card.\n\nAdditional constraint of the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$200\\,000$$$.\n\nFor each test case, print the maximum number of cards that Monocarp can take from the deck during the game, given that on the first turn he can take any card from the deck.\n\nInputs:\n4\n10 2\n5 2 4 3 4 3 4 5 3 2\n5 1\n10 11 10 11 10\n9 3\n4 5 4 4 6 5 4 4 6\n3 2\n1 3 1\n\n\nOutputs:\n6\n3\n9\n2\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        # Count occurrences of each number\n        count = {}\n        for num in a:\n            count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1\n        \n        # Try each possible starting number\n        max_cards = 0\n        for start in count:\n            # Try to take cards with at most k distinct numbers\n            taken = {}\n            remaining = count.copy()\n            \n            # Take the first card\n            taken[start] = 1\n            remaining[start] -= 1\n            if remaining[start] == 0:\n                del remaining[start]\n            \n            current = start\n            total_taken = 1\n            \n            # Continue taking cards\n            while True:\n                # Try to take a card with the same number\n                if current in remaining:\n                    taken[current] = taken.get(current, 0) + 1\n                    remaining[current] -= 1\n                    if remaining[current] == 0:\n                        del remaining[current]\n                    total_taken += 1\n                # Or try to take a card with number + 1\n                elif current + 1 in remaining and (current + 1 in taken or len(taken) < k):\n                    if current + 1 not in taken:\n                        taken[current + 1] = 0\n                    taken[current + 1] += 1\n                    remaining[current + 1] -= 1\n                    if remaining[current + 1] == 0:\n                        del remaining[current + 1]\n                    current += 1\n                    total_taken += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n            \n            max_cards = max(max_cards, total_taken)\n        \n        print(max_cards)\n\nsolve()\n```"}]}

You can perform the following operation on $$$a$$$:\n\n- Select an interval $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1\\le l\\le r\\le n$$$), then for each $$$l\\le i\\le r$$$, increase $$$a_i$$$ by $$$k$$$.\n\nFor each $$$1\\le p\\le m$$$, you have to find the minimum possible variance of $$$a$$$ after exactly $$$p$$$ operations are performed, independently for each $$$p$$$.\n\nFor simplicity, you only need to output the answers multiplied by $$$n^2$$$. It can be proven that the results are always integers.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.

And like ever before, Iris has set a problem to which she gave a wrong solution, but Chris is always supposed to save it! You are going to play the role of Chris now:\n\n- Chris is given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.\n- Iris is interested in the largest possible value of $$$P = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n \\min(a_i, b_i)$$$ after an arbitrary rearrangement of $$$b$$$. Note that she only wants to know the maximum value of $$$P$$$, and no actual rearrangement is performed on $$$b$$$.\n- There will be $$$q$$$ modifications. Each modification can be denoted by two integers $$$o$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$o$$$ is either $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$, $$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$). If $$$o = 1$$$, then Iris will increase $$$a_x$$$ by $$$1$$$; otherwise, she will increase $$$b_x$$$ by $$$1$$$.\n- Iris asks Chris the maximum value of $$$P$$$ for $$$q + 1$$$ times: once before any modification, then after every modification.\n- Since $$$P$$$ might be huge, Chris only needs to calculate it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nChris soon worked out this problem, but he was so tired that he fell asleep. Besides saying thanks to Chris, now it is your turn to write a program to calculate the answers for given input data.\n\nNote: since the input and output are large, you may need to optimize them for this problem.\n\nFor example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

In one day, you need to have time to analyze the training and thematic contests, give a lecture with new material, and, if possible, also hold a mini-seminar. Therefore, there is a break where students can go to drink coffee and chat with each other.\n\nThere are a total of $$$n+2$$$ coffee machines located in sequentially arranged rooms along a long corridor. The coffee machines are numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n+1$$$, and immediately after the break starts, there are $$$a_i$$$ students gathered around the $$$i$$$-th coffee machine.\n\nThe students are talking too loudly among themselves, and the teachers need to make a very important announcement. Therefore, they want to gather the maximum number of students around some single coffee machine. The teachers are too lazy to run around the corridors and gather the students, so they came up with a more sophisticated way to manipulate them:\n\n- At any moment, the teachers can choose room $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and turn off the lights there;\n- If there were $$$x$$$ students in that room, then after turning off the lights, $$$\\lfloor \\frac12 x \\rfloor$$$ students will go to room $$$(i-1)$$$, and $$$\\lfloor \\frac12 x \\rfloor$$$ other students will go to room $$$(i+1)$$$.\n- If $$$x$$$ was odd, then one student remains in the same room.\n- After that, the lights in room $$$i$$$ are turned back on.\n\nThe teachers have not yet decided where they will gather the students, so for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you should determine what is the maximum number of students that can be gathered around the $$$i$$$-th coffee machine.\n\nThe teachers can turn off the lights in any rooms at their discretion, in any order, possibly turning off the lights in the same room multiple times.\n\nNote that the values of $$$a_0$$$ and $$$a_{n+1}$$$ do not affect the answer to the problem, so their values will not be given to you.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, there is an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$).\n\nIn the second line of each test case, there are integers $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of students around coffee machines numbered $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.\n\nFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, \\ldots, b_n$$$, where $$$b_i$$$ is the maximum number of students that can be around coffee machines number $$$i$$$.\n\nInputs:\n3\n2\n8 0\n5\n2 2 2 2 2\n5\n0 0 9 0 0\n\n\nOutputs:\n8 4 \n4 5 4 5 4 \n4 6 9 6 4 \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        # Initialize the result array\n        result = a.copy()\n        \n        # For each position i, calculate the maximum number of students\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Try turning off lights in different rooms\n            for j in range(n):\n                if j == i:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Calculate distance and number of times to move students\n                distance = abs(i - j)\n                \n                # Calculate how many students can be moved from j to i\n                students_to_move = a[j] // (2 ** distance)\n                \n                # Update the result\n                result[i] = max(result[i], a[i] + students_to_move)\n        \n        print(*result)\n\nsolve()\n```"}]}

Return only the code and nothing else.\n\n\nProblem: You have $$$n$$$ barrels of infinite capacity. The $$$i$$$-th barrel initially contains $$$a_i$$$ kilograms of water. In this problem, we assume that all barrels weigh the same.\n\nYou know that exactly one of the barrels has a small amount of tropical poison distributed on its surface, with a total weight of $$$0.179$$$ kilograms. However, you do not know which barrel contains the poison. Your task is to identify this poisonous barrel.\n\nAll the barrels are on scales. Unfortunately, the scales do not show the exact weight of each barrel. Instead, for each pair of barrels, they show the result of a comparison between the weights of those barrels. Thus, for any two barrels, you can determine whether their weights are equal, and if not, which barrel is heavier. The poison and water are included in the weight of the barrel.\n\nThe scales are always turned on, and the information from them can be used an unlimited number of times.\n\nYou also have the ability to pour water. You can pour water from any barrel into any other barrel in any amounts.\n\nHowever, to pour water, you must physically handle the barrel from which you are pouring, so if that happens to be the poisonous barrel, you will die. This outcome must be avoided.\n\nHowever, you can pour water into the poisonous barrel without touching it.\n\nIn other words, you can choose the numbers $$$i, j, x$$$ ($$$i \\neq j, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n, 0 < x \\leq a_i$$$, the barrel numbered $$$i$$$\u00a0\u2014 not is poisonous) and execute $$$a_i := a_i - x$$$, $$$a_j := a_j + x$$$. Where $$$x$$$ is not necessarily an integer.\n\nIs it possible to guarantee the identification of which barrel contains the poison and remain alive using pouring and the information from the scales? You know that the poison is located on exactly one of the barrels.\n\nAdditionally, we ask you to process $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, either one of the existing barrels is removed, or an additional barrel with a certain amount of water is added. After each query, you need to answer whether it is possible to guarantee the identification of the poisonous barrel, given that there is exactly one.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) \u2014 the volumes of water in the existing barrels.\n\nThe next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is either of the form + x or - x, which means, respectively, adding and removing a barrel with $$$x$$$ kilograms of water. It is guaranteed that when the query - x is made, one of the existing barrels has a volume of $$$x$$$, and that there is always at least one barrel remaining throughout the queries. In all queries, $$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^6$$$.\n\nOutput $$$q+1$$$ lines, the answer to the problem before all queries, and after each query.

Naturally, there are a lot of bowling alleys all over the country, and the competition between them is as intense as you can imagine.\n\nMaw-Shang owns one such bowling alley. To stand out from other competitors in the industry and draw attention from customers, he decided to hold a special event every month that features various unorthodox bowling rules. For the event this month, he came up with a new version of the game called X-pin bowling. In the traditional $$$10$$$-pin bowling game, a frame is built out of ten bowling pins forming a triangular shape of side length four. The pin closest to the player forms the first row, and the two pins behind it form the second row, and so on. Unlike the standard version, the game of $$$X$$$-pin bowling Maw-Shang designed allows a much larger number of pins that form a larger frame. The following figure shows a standard $$$10$$$-pin frame on the left, and on the right it shows a $$$21$$$-pin frame that forms a triangular shape of side length six which is allowed in the game of $$$X$$$-pin bowling.\n\nBeing the national sport, the government of Taiwan strictly regulates and standardizes the manufacturing of bowling pins. There are two types of bowling pins allowed, one in black and the other in white, and the bowling alley Maw-Shang owns has $$$w$$$ white pins and $$$b$$$ black pins. To make this new game exciting for the customers, Maw-Shang wants to build the largest possible frame from these $$$w+b$$$ pins. However, even though he is okay with using both colors in building the frame, for aesthetic reasons, Maw-Shang still wants the colors of the pins on the same row to be identical. For example, the following figure shows two possible frames of side length six, but only the left one is acceptable to Maw-Shang since the other one has white and black pins mixed in the third row.\n\nThe monthly special event is happening in just a few hours. Please help Maw-Shang calculate the side length of the largest frame that he can build from his $$$w+b$$$ pins!\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$, the number of test cases.

Your task is to find the fastest way to get from the start to the end position. The fastest way is to make the minimum number of steps where one step is going left, right, up, or down. Of course, you cannot walk through walls.\n\nThere is, however, a catch: If you make more than three steps in the same direction, you lose balance and fall down. Therefore, it is forbidden to make more than three consecutive steps in the same direction.

She receives a sheet of paper with an $$$n \\times n$$$ grid and begins drawing \"lines\" on it. Well\u2014the concept of a \"line\" here is not what we usually think of. Claire refers each line to be a set of consecutive vertical grid cells. When she draws a line, these cells are all covered with black ink. Initially, all the cells are white, and drawing lines turns some of them black. After drawing a few lines, Claire wonders: how many ways she can color an additional white cell black so that the remaining white cells do not form a single connected component.\n\nTwo cells are directly connected if they share an edge. Two cells $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are indirectly connected if there exists a sequence of cells $$$c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_k$$$ with $$$k > 1$$$ such that $$$c_0 = x$$$, $$$c_k = y$$$, and for every $$$i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$$$ the cells $$$c_i$$$ and $$$c_{i-1}$$$ are directly connected. A set of cells forms a single connected component if each pair of cells in the set is either directly or indirectly connected.\n\nThe grid has $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns, both indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Claire will draw $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line is drawn in the $$$y_i$$$-th column, from the $$$s_i$$$-th row to the $$$f_i$$$-th row, where $$$s_i \\leq f_i$$$ for each $$$i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, q\\}$$$. Note that the cells that are passed by at least one of the $$$q$$$ lines are colored black. The following figure shows an example of a $$$20\\times 20$$$ grid with $$$q=67$$$ lines. The grid cells marked with red star symbols refer to the cells such that, if Claire colors that cell black, all white cells no longer form a single connected component.\n\nYou may assume that, after drawing the $$$q$$$ lines, the remaining white cells form a single connected component with at least three white cells.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains exactly one integer $$$t$$$, indicating the number of test cases.

As a singing enthusiast, Alice has listened to countless songs and has tried singing them many times. However, occasionally, some songs make Alice feel bored. After some research, Alice believes that this is because even though the songs she chose are all different, due to her instinctive preference, they all turn out to be musically similar to one another.\n\nTo thoroughly analyze this, Alice decided to study the sheet music of the songs. For convenience, Alice represented a song of length $$$n$$$ as an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the pitch of the $$$i$$$-th note. Then she defined the musical equivalence between songs. Two songs $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ are musically equivalent if for all $$$1\\leq i<n$$$, both $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ and $$$b_{i}, b_{i+1}$$$ have the same pitch relationship. More specifically, $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ and $$$b_i, b_{i+1}$$$ have the same pitch relationship if either\n\n- $$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i < b_{i + 1}$$$,\n- $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i = b_{i + 1}$$$, or\n- $$$a_i > a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i > b_{i + 1}$$$.\n\nHaving practiced consistently for a long time, Alice is able to sing any note in the range of $$$[1, k]$$$. She wants to know how many different songs of length $$$n$$$ within her range there are, if we treat musically equivalent songs as the same one.

Here is how it will work: if a user types \"App\", your editor will magically suggest the word \"Application\"! Even better, users can personalize the words that auto-complete in your editor.\n\nYour editor will support 4 kinds of operations (Let's say the current text in your editor is $$$t$$$):\n\n1.

At first, there is nothing on the screen, so \"charlie\" (3) should be suggested because it is the longest. Then, let us say the user types \"b\".

To showcase the depth of its collections, the bar has a two-row wine rack where each row can fit exactly $$$n$$$ bottles. There are already $$$n$$$ bottles placed on the back row of the rack, where the $$$i$$$-th bottle from left has height $$$a_i$$$. The owner of the bar has another $$$n$$$ bottles with distinct heights $$$b_1, \\ldots, b_n$$$ that he would like Mayaw to put on the first row. To ensure that all bottles on the rack are visible, the owner requires that each bottle on the back row should not be blocked by the one put in front of it. That is, if a bottle of height $$$h$$$ is put on the $$$i$$$-th spot (from left) in the first row, then $$$h$$$ must be less than $$$a_i$$$. However, not all such arrangements are good for the owner. To pay tributes to the Maxi Mountain nearby, he additionally demands that the bottles in the front row should display a mountain-like shape. In particular, the heights of the bottles, when listing from left to right, should form a sequence that is first (non-strictly) increasing and then (non-strictly) decreasing.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes it is impossible to achieve owner's requirements. That is why Mayaw is also allowed to slightly reduce a bottle's height by removing its cap that has a height of $$$1$$$. In other words, after the removal of the cap, the height of the bottle decreases by exactly $$$1$$$. Of course, exposing the Epah inside the bottle to the open air is detrimental to its quality, and therefore it is desirable to remove as few bottle caps as possible.\n\nCan you help Mayaw determine the minimum number of caps needed to be removed so that he can arrange the bottles in a way that satisfies the owner's requirements?

This graph structure allows them to simulate the flow of energy throughout the ecosystem from one species to another.\n\nTwo essential features of the ecosystem are defined:\n\n- Independent Trophic Group: A set $$$S$$$ of animal species is classified as an independent trophic group if no species $$$x \\in S$$$ can reach another species $$$y \\in S$$$ (for some $$$y \\ne x$$$) through a series of directed feeding relationships, meaning there is no directed path in $$$D$$$ from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$.\n- Trophic Balance Species: A species is termed a trophic balance species if it has a nearly equal number of species that affect it as directly or indirectly predators (species it can reach via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself) and species that affect it as directly or indirectly prey (species that can reach it via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself).

There are no directed paths between Foxes (Node 3) and Hawks (Node 4); Foxes cannot reach Hawks, and Hawks cannot reach Foxes through any directed paths.

Thus, she decides to rebuild her castle into some specific shape to make her it more beautiful.\n\nLet's say we represent A-Ju's castle as a 2D convex polygon$$$^{\\text{\u2217}}$$$ on the 2D plane. A-Ju aims to rebuild her castle into a point symmetric convex polygon. Here, a polygon is point symmetric if there exists a center $$$c$$$ such that for every point $$$p$$$ in the polygon, the reflection $$$p^\\prime$$$ of $$$p$$$ across $$$c$$$ is also in the polygon.\n\nWhile designing an arbitrary point symmetric convex polygon shape is easy, the cost of rebuilding is very high. After some estimation, A-Ju found that the cost of rebuilding is proportional to the area of the symmetric difference$$$^{\\text{\u2020}}$$$ between the original castle and the new castle. See the following figure for an example:\n\nIn the example above, A-Ju's castle is a shape of the convex polygon formed by points $$$(3, 7) - (2, 1) - (6, 3)$$$. After rebuilding her castle into the shape of the polygon formed by $$$(3, 7) - (\\frac{7}{3}, 3) - (\\frac{13}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}) - (5, \\frac{13}{3})$$$, the area of the symmetric difference between these two polygons will be $$$\\frac{11}{3}$$$. The difference can be calculated as the sum of the additional area (represented by the green grid region) and the shaved area (represented by the red line region).\n\nPlease write a program that helps A-Ju design a blueprint of the new castle, such that the area of the symmetric difference between the original one and the new one is minimized. You only need to output the minimum value since A-Ju wants to estimate her cost first.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$, representing the number of vertices of the polygon that forms A-Ju's castle.\n\nThen, $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains two integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$, representing the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th vertex. The vertices are given in a counterclockwise order.\n\n- $$$3\\leq n\\leq 500$$$\n- $$$|x_i|, |y_i|\\leq 10^4$$$\n- The vertices are given in a counterclockwise order and are guaranteed to form a convex polygon without three collinear points.\n\nPrint a single real number in one line, representing the minimum area of the symmetric difference between the original castle and the new castle.\n\nYour answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-4}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$.

The task is to implement an $$$O(n^2)$$$-time algorithm to sort $$$n$$$ given integers in non-decreasing order. Alice has already completed her assignment, and her implementation is shown below.\n\nWhile you have access to Alice's code, you prefer not to simply copy it. Instead, you want to use Alice's sorting function as a building block for your own solution. There are two ways as listed below you can utilize her function, but each of them can be applied at most once. The order in which these two operations are invoked can be arbitrary.\n\n- Prefix sort: choose a length $$$i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$ and call $$$\\texttt{alicesort(}s, i\\texttt{)}$$$. This sorts the first $$$i$$$ elements in the array $$$s$$$.\n- Suffix sort: choose a length $$$i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$ and call $$$\\texttt{alicesort(}s+n-i, i\\texttt{)}$$$. This sorts the last $$$i$$$ elements in the array $$$s$$$.\n\nDue to the time complexity of the sorting algorithm, the cost of performing either a prefix or suffix sort is $$$i^2$$$, where $$$i$$$ is the length of the chosen subarray. Your goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort the input array $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers in non-decreasing order using Alice's function, following the rules mentioned above.\n\nFor example, Let $$$s=[3,2,5,5,4,1]$$$. We can first perform a suffix sort of length $$$4$$$, and the array becomes $$$[3,2,1,4,5,5]$$$. Then, we perform a prefix sort of length $$$3$$$, and the array becomes $$$[1,2,3,4,5,5]$$$, which is a sorted array. The cost is $$$4^2+3^2=25$$$. Here is another example, let $$$s=[4,3,2,1]$$$. We can complete the sorting by performing only a prefix sort of length $$$4$$$, and the cost is $$$4^2=16$$$.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line contains exactly one integer $$$n$$$ which indicates the number of integers in the array $$$s$$$.

Return only the code and nothing else.\n\n\nProblem: The country of Truckski is located in a rugged, mountainous region, and the geological condition has engendered a wide range of issues. The challenging terrain separates the different states in the country, resulting in an extremely inconvenient inter-state commute and more crucially a lack of central governmental control. Adding on top of that is a rampant crime rate that increases annually, and this severely disrupts the everyday lives of innocent citizens.\n\nA recent protest finally shed light on the situation, as the newly elected president has announced an ambitious project to resolve these issues. Her plan consists of two major components. The first is the construction of high-speed railways between the states to facilitate better connections and unity across the country. Since the states are mostly running independently from each other, to construct a railway between states $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, the government has to pay a fee of $$$a_u + a_v$$$ dollars, with $$$a_u$$$ dollars given to state $$$u$$$ and $$$a_v$$$ dollars given to state $$$v$$$. The railway operates bidirectionally, meaning that once it is built, people from state $$$u$$$ can now travel to state $$$v$$$ and vice versa. A railway can be built between almost any pair of states, except for $$$m$$$ particular pairs for which the terrain dividing them is so treacherous that the construction of a direct railroad between the two states becomes impossible.\n\nThe second component of the project is to build a centralized prison that manages all criminals across the country. Given the large number of estimated prisoners, the president decided to pick one of the states to build the central prison and sever the connection from the state to the rest of the country.\n\nAn illustration for the sample input 1. (a) The costs of building direct railways between the states. (b) Consider building the central prison in State #3. All direct railroads that do not involve State #3 have to be built, with a total cost of $$$3+3+2=8$$$ dollars.\n\nGiven the above, the president would like to search for the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between the states so that:\n\n- the state with the central prison should not have any railway connecting it to any other states, and\n- all the other states should be connected, i.e., people should be able to travel from one such state to another, possibly by taking more than one train.\n\nYou are working for the team in charge of the overall planning of the construction. The meeting with the president is happening in just a few hours, at which time you will have to brief her on the cost of different construction plans. Please calculate, for each state $$$u$$$, the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between states meeting the above conditions when $$$u$$$ is where the central prison is built.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, the number of states in Truckski and the number of pairs for which railroad construction is not feasible. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$, the construction fee the government needs to pay to the $$$i$$$-th state. Then, $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ meaning that it is impossible to build a (direct) railway between states $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.\n\n- $$$2\\leq n\\leq 10^5$$$\n- $$$0\\leq m\\leq 10^5$$$\n- $$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^9$$$\n- $$$1\\leq u_i<v_i\\leq n$$$\n- For all $$$i\\neq j, (u_i, v_i)\\neq (u_j, v_j)$$$.\n\nOutput $$$n$$$ integers in one line.

With an aura of an odd positive integer $$$X$$$, moving from a cell with height $$$h_1$$$ to a cell with height $$$h_2$$$ gives you a penalty of $$$(h_1 - h_2)^X$$$. Note that the penalty can be negative.\n\nYou want to answer $$$Q$$$ independent scenarios. In each scenario, you start at the starting cell $$$(R_s, C_s)$$$ and you want to go to the destination cell $$$(R_f, C_f)$$$ with minimum total penalty. In some scenarios, the total penalty might become arbitrarily small; such a scenario is called invalid. Find the minimum total penalty to move from the starting cell to the destination cell, or determine if the scenario is invalid.\n\nInput and Output Format:\nThe first line consists of three integers $$$R$$$ $$$C$$$ $$$X$$$ ($$$1 \\leq R, C \\leq 1000; 1 \\leq X \\leq 9; X$$$ is an odd integer).\n\nEach of the next $$$R$$$ lines consists of a string $$$H_r$$$ of length $$$C$$$. Each character in $$$H_r$$$ is a number from 0 to 9. The $$$c$$$-th character of $$$H_r$$$ represents the height of cell $$$(r, c)$$$, or $$$H_{r, c}$$$.\n\nThe next line consists of an integer $$$Q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq Q \\leq 100\\,000)$$$.\n\nEach of the next $$$Q$$$ lines consists of four integers $$$R_s$$$ $$$C_s$$$ $$$R_f$$$ $$$C_f$$$ ($$$1 \\leq R_s, R_f \\leq R; 1 \\leq C_s, C_f \\leq C$$$).\n\nFor each scenario, output the following in a single line. If the scenario is invalid, output INVALID. Otherwise, output a single integer representing the minimum total penalty to move from the starting cell to the destination cell.\n\nInputs:\n3 4 1\n3359\n4294\n3681\n5\n1 1 3 4\n3 3 2 1\n2 2 1 4\n1 3 3 2\n1 1 1 1\n\n\nOutputs:\n2\n4\n-7\n-1\n0\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    R, C, X = map(int, input().split())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        grid.append([int(c) for c in input().strip()])\n    \n    Q = int(input())\n    \n    for _ in range(Q):\n        Rs, Cs, Rf, Cf = map(int, input().split())\n        Rs -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed\n        Cs -= 1\n        Rf -= 1\n        Cf -= 1\n        \n        # Dijkstra's algorithm\n        dist = [[float('inf')] * C for _ in range(R)]\n        dist[Rs][Cs] = 0\n        pq = [(0, Rs, Cs)]  # (penalty, row, col)\n        \n        # Directions: up, right, down, left\n        dr = [-1, 0, 1, 0]\n        dc = [0, 1, 0, -1]\n        \n        visited = set()\n        \n        while pq:\n            penalty, r, c = heapq.heappop(pq)\n            \n            if (r, c) in visited:\n                continue\n            \n            visited.add((r, c))\n            \n            if r == Rf and c == Cf:\n                break\n            \n            for i in range(4):\n                nr, nc = r + dr[i], c + dc[i]\n                if 0 <= nr < R and 0 <= nc < C:\n                    h1 = grid[r][c]\n                    h2 = grid[nr][nc]\n                    new_penalty = penalty + (h1 - h2) ** X\n                    \n                    if new_penalty < dist[nr][nc]:\n                        dist[nr][nc] = new_penalty\n                        heapq.heappush(pq, (new_penalty, nr, nc))\n        \n        # Check for negative cycles\n        # For odd X, if there's a cycle with a height difference, we can get arbitrarily small penalty\n        # We'll use Bellman-Ford to detect negative cycles\n        \n        # Initialize distances for Bellman-Ford\n        bf_dist = [[float('inf')] * C for _ in range(R)]\n        bf_dist[Rs][Cs] = 0\n        \n        # Relax all edges |V|-1 times\n        for _ in range(R * C - 1):\n            for r in range(R):\n                for c in range(C):\n                    if bf_dist[r][c] == float('inf'):\n                        continue\n                    \n                    for i in range(4):\n                        nr, nc = r + dr[i], c + dc[i]\n                        if 0 <= nr < R and 0 <= nc < C:\n                            h1 = grid[r][c]\n                            h2 = grid[nr][nc]\n                            new_penalty = bf_dist[r][c] + (h1 - h2) ** X\n                            \n                            if new_penalty < bf_dist[nr][nc]:\n                                bf_dist[nr][nc] = new_penalty\n        \n        # Check for negative cycles\n        has_negative_cycle = False\n        for r in range(R):\n            for c in range(C):\n                if bf_dist[r][c] == float('inf'):\n                    continue\n                \n                for i in range(4):\n                    nr, nc = r + dr[i], c + dc[i]\n                    if 0 <= nr < R and 0 <= nc < C:\n                        h1 = grid[r][c]\n                        h2 = grid[nr][nc]\n                        if bf_dist[r][c] + (h1 - h2) ** X < bf_dist[nr][nc]:\n                            has_negative_cycle = True\n                            break\n                \n                if has_negative_cycle:\n                    break\n            \n            if has_negative_cycle:\n                break\n        \n        # Check if there's a path from start to destination\n        if has_negative_cycle:\n            # Check if the negative cycle is reachable from start and can reach destination\n            if dist[Rf][Cf] != float('inf'):\n                print(\"INVALID\")\n            else:\n                print(dist[Rf][Cf])\n        else:\n            print(dist[Rf][Cf])\n\nsolve()\n```"}]}

Every cell in this grid is a square of the same size. The cell located at row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ is denoted as $$$(r, c)$$$. Each cell can either be empty or have a mirror in one of the cell's diagonals. Each mirror is represented by a line segment. The mirror is type $$$1$$$ if it is positioned diagonally from the southwest corner to the northeast corner of the cell, or type $$$2$$$ for the other diagonal.\n\nThese mirrors follow the law of reflection, that is, the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. Formally, for type $$$1$$$ mirror, if a beam of light comes from the north, south, west, or east of the cell, then it will be reflected to the west, east, north, and south of the cell, respectively. Similarly, for type $$$2$$$ mirror, if a beam of light comes from the north, south, west, or east of the cell, then it will be reflected to the east, west, south, and north of the cell, respectively.\n\nYou want to put a laser from outside the grid such that all mirrors are hit by the laser beam.

Naturally, he's sending it back in the most inconvenient manner possible.\n\nA crow is sitting at position $$$0$$$ of the number line. There are $$$n$$$ scarecrows positioned at integer coordinates $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ along the number line. These scarecrows have been enchanted, allowing them to move left and right at a speed of $$$1$$$ unit per second.\n\nThe crow is afraid of scarecrows and wants to stay at least a distance of $$$k$$$ ahead of the nearest scarecrow positioned at or before it. To do so, the crow uses its teleportation ability as follows:\n\n- Let $$$x$$$ be the current position of the crow, and let $$$y$$$ be the largest position of a scarecrow such that $$$y \\le x$$$. If $$$x - y < k$$$, meaning the scarecrow is too close, the crow will instantly teleport to position $$$y + k$$$.\n\nThis teleportation happens instantly and continuously. The crow will keep checking for scarecrows positioned at or to the left of him and teleport whenever one gets too close (which could happen at non-integral times). Note that besides this teleportation ability, the crow will not move on its own.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum time required to make the crow teleport to a position greater than or equal to $$$\\ell$$$, assuming the scarecrows move optimally to allow the crow to reach its goal. For convenience, you are asked to output twice the minimum time needed for the crow to reach the target position $$$\\ell$$$. It can be proven that this value will always be an integer.\n\nNote that the scarecrows can start, stop, or change direction at any time (possibly at non-integral times).\n\nInput and Output Format:\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

These positions should satisfy the following:\n\n- The positions of the stones in the first line match the initial state from the input, in any order.\n- The positions of the stones in the last line match the target state from the input, in any order.\n- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\leq i\\leq k$$$) and $$$j$$$ ($$$1\\leq j\\leq c$$$), ensure that the $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line and the $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$(i+1)$$$-th line correspond to adjacent vertices in the graph. In other words, the stone is moved from its previous position to the next.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nInputs:\n4\n2 1\n10\n01\n1 2\n11 11\n11011001010\n01101011100\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n7 8\n8 9\n9 10\n10 11\n11 1\n3 2\n110\n101\n1 2\n2 3\n3 2\n111\n111\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\nOutputs:\nYes\n3\n1 \n2 \n1 \n2 \nYes\n22\n1 2 4 5 8 10 \n2 1 3 6 9 11 \n1 2 4 7 8 10 \n2 1 3 8 9 11 \n3 2 4 9 8 10 \n4 1 3 10 9 11 \n5 2 4 9 8 1 \n6 1 3 10 9 2 \n7 2 4 9 10 3 \n8 1 3 10 11 4 \n7 2 4 9 1 5 \n8 1 3 10 2 6 \n7 2 4 9 3 5 \n8 1 3 10 4 6 \n7 2 4 9 3 5 \n8 1 3 10 4 6 \n7 2 4 9 3 5 \n8 1 5 10 4 6 \n7 2 6 9 3 5 \n8 1 7 10 4 6 \n7 2 8 9 3 5 \n8 1 9 10 4 6 \n7 2 8 9 3 5 \nNo\nYes\n0\n1 2 3 \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        s = input().strip()\n        t_str = input().strip()\n        \n        # Build the graph\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        for _ in range(m):\n            u, v = map(int, input().split())\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        # Get initial and target stone positions\n        initial_stones = [i+1 for i in range(n) if s[i] == '1']\n        target_stones = [i+1 for i in range(n) if t_str[i] == '1']\n        \n        if len(initial_stones) != len(target_stones):\n            print(\"No\")\n            continue\n        \n        if len(initial_stones) == 0:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # If initial and target are the same, no moves needed\n        if sorted(initial_stones) == sorted(target_stones):\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            print(0)\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, initial_stones)))\n            continue\n        \n        # BFS to find the shortest path\n        queue = deque([(initial_stones, 0, [initial_stones])])\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add(tuple(sorted(initial_stones)))\n        \n        found = False\n        while queue and not found:\n            current_stones, moves, path = queue.popleft()\n            \n            if moves > 2 * n:\n                continue\n            \n            if sorted(current_stones) == sorted(target_stones):\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                print(moves)\n                for p in path:\n                    print(\" \".join(map(str, p)))\n                found = True\n                break\n            \n            # Try all possible next moves\n            possible_moves = []\n            for i, stone in enumerate(current_stones):\n                for neighbor in graph[stone]:\n                    if neighbor not in current_stones:\n                        possible_moves.append((i, neighbor))\n            \n            for moves_subset in get_valid_move_subsets(current_stones, possible_moves):\n                new_stones = current_stones.copy()\n                for idx, new_pos in moves_subset:\n                    new_stones[idx] = new_pos\n                \n                new_stones_tuple = tuple(sorted(new_stones))\n                if new_stones_tuple not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_stones_tuple)\n                    queue.append((new_stones, moves + 1, path + [new_stones]))\n        \n        if not found:\n            print(\"No\")\n\ndef get_valid_move_subsets(current_stones, possible_moves):\n    # Generate all valid subsets of moves where no two stones move to the same vertex\n    result = []\n    \n    def backtrack(idx, current_subset, used_targets):\n        if idx == len(possible_moves):\n            if current_subset:  # Only add non-empty subsets\n                result.append(current_subset.copy())\n            return\n        \n        # Skip this move\n        backtrack(idx + 1, current_subset, used_targets)\n        \n        # Take this move if target is not used\n        stone_idx, target = possible_moves[idx]\n        if target not in used_targets and target not in [current_stones[i] for i in range(len(current_stones)) if i != stone_idx]:\n            current_subset.append((stone_idx, target))\n            used_targets.add(target)\n            backtrack(idx + 1, current_subset, used_targets)\n            used_targets.remove(target)\n            current_subset.pop()\n    \n    backtrack(0, [], set())\n    return result\n\nsolve()\n```"}]}

In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.\n\nInputs:\n2\n4 4\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n2 0\n3 0\n4 0\n3 1\n12 10\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n1 5\n5 6\n6 7\n6 8\n6 9\n8 10\n10 11\n10 12\n6 0\n9 0\n10 0\n11 0\n3 1\n7 1\n10 1\n12 1\n12 2\n11 12\n\n\nOutputs:\n1\n6\n6\n2\n4\n9\n8\n15\n2\n3\n6\n9\n5\n5\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\ndef mod_inverse(a, m):\n    g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, m)\n    if g != 1:\n        raise Exception('Modular inverse does not exist')\n    else:\n        return x % m\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    if a == 0:\n        return b, 0, 1\n    else:\n        gcd, x, y = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\n        return gcd, y - (b // a) * x, x\n\ndef solve():\n    MOD = 998244353\n    \n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n, q = map(int, input().split())\n        \n        # Build the tree\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n        for _ in range(n-1):\n            u, v = map(int, input().split())\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        # Calculate distances from vertex 1\n        dist = [0] * (n+1)\n        parent = [0] * (n+1)\n        \n        def dfs(node, prev, d):\n            dist[node] = d\n            parent[node] = prev\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor != prev:\n                    dfs(neighbor, node, d+1)\n        \n        dfs(1, 0, 0)\n        \n        # Process queries\n        for _ in range(q):\n            v, p = map(int, input().split())\n            \n            # Calculate f(v, p)\n            distance = dist[v]\n            \n            # If p >= distance/2, we can pay for all even steps\n            if p >= distance // 2:\n                print(distance)\n                continue\n            \n            # Otherwise, we need to calculate the expected value\n            # We'll pay for the first p even steps\n            steps_with_payment = 2 * p + (distance - 2 * p)\n            \n            # For the remaining (distance/2 - p) even steps, we need to calculate expected value\n            # For each unpaid even step, the expected number of steps is 2\n            # (1 step with probability 1/deg, and 1+2 steps with probability (deg-1)/deg)\n            \n            # Calculate the expected value for the path\n            expected_value = steps_with_payment\n            \n            # For each unpaid even step\n            current = v\n            paid_even_steps = 0\n            \n            while current != 1:\n                if dist[current] % 2 == dist[v] % 2:  # Even step (relative to starting position)\n                    if paid_even_steps < p:\n                        paid_even_steps += 1\n                    else:\n                        # This is an unpaid even step\n                        deg = len(graph[current])\n                        # Probability of going towards vertex 1 is 1/deg\n                        # Probability of going away is (deg-1)/deg\n                        # If we go away, we add 2 more steps (go away and come back)\n                        expected_value += 2 * (deg - 1) / deg\n                \n                current = parent[current]\n            \n            # Convert to the required format (p/q mod MOD)\n            # First, find the denominator (which is a power of the degrees)\n            denominator = 1\n            current = v\n            paid_even_steps = 0\n            \n            while current != 1:\n                if dist[current] % 2 == dist[v] % 2:  # Even step\n                    if paid_even_steps < p:\n                        paid_even_steps += 1\n                    else:\n                        denominator *= len(graph[current])\n                current = parent[current]\n            \n            # Calculate numerator * denominator^(-1) mod MOD\n            numerator = int(expected_value * denominator)\n            result = (numerator * mod_inverse(denominator, MOD)) % MOD\n            \n            print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```"}]}
