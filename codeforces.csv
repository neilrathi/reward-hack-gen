0,"Problem: Today, Little John used all his savings to buy a segment. He wants to build a house on this segment.

A segment of positive integers $$$[l,r]$$$ is called coprime if $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are coprime$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$.

A coprime segment $$$[l,r]$$$ is called minimal coprime if it does not contain$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ any coprime segment not equal to itself. To better understand this statement, you can refer to the notes.

Given $$$[l,r]$$$, a segment of positive integers, find the number of minimal coprime segments contained in $$$[l,r]$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case consists of two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le 10^9$$$).

3,"Problem: Even Little John needs money to buy a house. But he recently lost his job; how will he earn money now? Of course, by playing a game that gives him money as a reward! Oh well, maybe not those kinds of games you are thinking about.

There are $$$n+m$$$ distinct points $$$(a_1,0), (a_2,0), \ldots, (a_{n},0), (b_1,2), (b_2,2), \ldots, (b_{m},2)$$$ on the plane. Initially, your score is $$$0$$$. To increase your score, you can perform the following operation:

- Choose three distinct points which are not collinear;
- Increase your score by the area of the triangle formed by these three points;
- Then, erase the three points from the plane.

An instance of the game, where the operation is performed twice.

Let $$$k_{\max}$$$ be the maximum number of operations that can be performed. For example, if it is impossible to perform any operation, $$$k_\max$$$ is $$$0$$$. Additionally, define $$$f(k)$$$ as the maximum possible score achievable by performing the operation exactly $$$k$$$ times. Here, $$$f(k)$$$ is defined for all integers $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \le k \le k_{\max}$$$.

Find the value of $$$k_{\max}$$$, and find the values of $$$f(x)$$$ for all integers $$$x=1,2,\ldots,k_{\max}$$$ independently.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le {3 \cdot 10^4}$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n,m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n}$$$ — the points on $$$y=0$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_{m}$$$ — the points on $$$y=2$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, given that the maximum number of operations is $$$k_{\max}$$$, you must output at most two lines:

- The first line contains the value of $$$k_{\max}$$$;
- The second line contains $$$k_{\max}$$$ integers denoting $$$f(1),f(2),\ldots,f(k_{\max})$$$. You are allowed to omit this line if $$$k_{\max}$$$ is $$$0$$$.

5,"Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ are smaller. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.

Now Little John is rich, and so he finally buys a house big enough to fit himself and his favorite bracket sequence. But somehow, he ended up with a lot of brackets! Frustrated, he penetrates through the ceiling with the ""buddha palm"".

A bracket sequence is called balanced if it can be constructed by the following formal grammar.

1. The empty sequence $$$\varnothing$$$ is balanced.
2. If the bracket sequence $$$A$$$ is balanced, then $$$\mathtt{(}A\mathtt{)}$$$ is also balanced.
3. If the bracket sequences $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are balanced, then the concatenated sequence $$$A B$$$ is also balanced.

For example, the sequences ""(())()"", ""()"", ""(()(()))"", and the empty sequence are balanced, while ""(()"" and ""(()))("" are not.

Given a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$, a pair of indices $$$(i,j)$$$ ($$$i<j$$$) is called a good pair if $$$s_i$$$ is '(', $$$s_j$$$ is ')', and the two brackets are added simultaneously with respect to Rule 2 while constructing the sequence $$$s$$$. For example, the sequence ""(())()"" has three different good pairs, which are $$$(1,4)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, and $$$(5,6)$$$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $$$2n$$$ brackets contains exactly $$$n$$$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.

Emily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.

Initially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $$$n$$$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.

Throughout $$$n$$$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.

- $$$l\;r$$$: The sequence $$$s$$$ contains a good pair $$$(l,r)$$$.

The clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.

At a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $$$s$$$ has $$$3$$$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Out of $$$5$$$ balanced bracket sequences with $$$3$$$ good pairs, there exists only one such sequence ""((()))"" with the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need $$$n$$$ turns to guess $$$s$$$.

To find out the content of $$$s$$$ as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn. As the answers may be huge, you need to find them modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 5000$$$) — the number of good pairs.

Then, each of the $$$n$$$ following lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ representing the $$$i$$$-th clue ($$$1 \le l_i < r_i \le 2n$$$).

The clues in one test case are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.

For each test case, output $$$n+1$$$ integers on a separate line:

- The first integer is the answer before all clues, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

For each test case, on the first line output a single string ""YES"" or ""NO"" (without the quotes) denoting whether Alice can trade up to card $$$n$$$.

If the first line was ""YES"", then on the next line output $$$k$$$ — the number of trades Alice will make. On the next $$$k$$$ lines output space separated a character $$$c\in \{\texttt{q}, \texttt{k}, \texttt{j}\}$$$ and integer $$$x$$$, denoting that Alice trades with player $$$c$$$ to get card $$$x$$$. It must be the case that on the $$$k$$$'th line, $$$x = n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can output this answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings ""yEs"", ""yes"", ""Yes"", and ""YES"" will be recognized as positive responses. The same goes for the character $$$c$$$ denoting the player in the trade ($$$\texttt{Q}, \texttt{K}, \texttt{J}$$$ will all be accepted alongside their lowercase variants).

11,"Problem: Alice is at the bottom of the rabbit hole! The rabbit hole can be modeled as a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ which has an exit at vertex $$$1$$$, and Alice starts at some vertex $$$v$$$. She wants to get out of the hole, but unfortunately, the Queen of Hearts has ordered her execution.

Each minute, a fair coin is flipped. If it lands heads, Alice gets to move to an adjacent vertex of her current location, and otherwise, the Queen of Hearts gets to pull Alice to an adjacent vertex of the Queen's choosing. If Alice ever ends up on any of the non-root leaves$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of the tree, Alice loses.

Assuming both of them move optimally, compute the probability that Alice manages to escape for every single starting vertex $$$1\le v\le n$$$. Since these probabilities can be very small, output them modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Formally, let $$$M = 998\,244\,353$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.

Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.

Initially, Elsie starts on island $$$1$$$, and Bessie starts on island $$$s$$$. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island $$$i$$$. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to island $$$j$$$, then the cow can move to island $$$j$$$. Then, island $$$i$$$ collapses, and all bridges connecting to island $$$i$$$ also collapse. Also, note the following:

- If there are no bridges connecting island $$$i$$$ to another island, then island $$$i$$$ collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.
- If the other cow is also on island $$$i$$$, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.

23,"Problem: Alice and Bob are playing a game. There is a list of $$$n$$$ booleans, each of which is either true or false, given as a binary string $$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (where $$$\texttt{1}$$$ represents true, and $$$\texttt{0}$$$ represents false). Initially, there are no operators between the booleans.

Alice and Bob will take alternate turns placing and or or between the booleans, with Alice going first. Thus, the game will consist of $$$n-1$$$ turns since there are $$$n$$$ booleans. Alice aims for the final statement to evaluate to true, while Bob aims for it to evaluate to false. Given the list of boolean values, determine whether Alice will win if both players play optimally.

To evaluate the final expression, repeatedly perform the following steps until the statement consists of a single true or false:

- If the statement contains an and operator, choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding it with its evaluation.
- Otherwise, the statement contains an or operator. Choose any one and replace the subexpression surrounding the or with its evaluation.

A max-heap is deterministic if the $$$\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first and the second time.

Initially, $$$a_v := 0$$$ for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation $$$\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times:

- Choose an integer $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 2^n - 1$$$) and, for every vertex $$$x$$$ on the path between $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$, add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_x$$$.

Two heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.

Since the answer might be large, print it modulo $$$p$$$.

48,"Problem: Narek is too lazy to create the third problem of this contest. His friend Artur suggests that he should use ChatGPT. ChatGPT creates $$$n$$$ problems, each consisting of $$$m$$$ letters, so Narek has $$$n$$$ strings. To make the problem harder, he combines the problems by selecting some of the $$$n$$$ strings possibly none and concatenating them without altering their order. His chance of solving the problem is defined as $$$score_n - score_c$$$, where $$$score_n$$$ is Narek's score and $$$score_c$$$ is ChatGPT's score.

Narek calculates $$$score_n$$$ by examining the selected string (he moves from left to right). He initially searches for the letter $$$\texttt{""n""}$$$, followed by $$$\texttt{""a""}$$$, $$$\texttt{""r""}$$$, $$$\texttt{""e""}$$$, and $$$\texttt{""k""}$$$. Upon finding all occurrences of these letters, he increments $$$score_n$$$ by $$$5$$$ and resumes searching for $$$\texttt{""n""}$$$ again (he doesn't go back, and he just continues from where he left off).

After Narek finishes, ChatGPT scans through the array and increments $$$score_c$$$ by $$$1$$$ for each letter $$$\texttt{""n""}$$$, $$$\texttt{""a""}$$$, $$$\texttt{""r""}$$$, $$$\texttt{""e""}$$$, or $$$\texttt{""k""}$$$ that Narek fails to utilize (note that if Narek fails to complete the last occurrence by finding all of the $$$5$$$ letters, then all of the letters he used are counted in ChatGPT's score $$$score_c$$$, and Narek doesn't get any points if he doesn't finish finding all the 5 letters).

Narek aims to maximize the value of $$$score_n - score_c$$$ by selecting the most optimal subset of the initial strings.

59,"Problem: The only difference between the two versions of the problem is whether overlaps are considered at all points or only at integer points.

The legendary Simurgh, a mythical bird, is responsible for keeping watch over vast lands, and for this purpose, she has enlisted $$$n$$$ vigilant warriors. Each warrior is alert during a specific time segment $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$, where $$$l_i$$$ is the start time (included) and $$$r_i$$$ is the end time (included), both positive integers.

One of Simurgh's trusted advisors, Zal, is concerned that if multiple warriors are stationed at the same time and all wear the same color, the distinction between them might be lost, causing confusion in the watch. To prevent this, whenever multiple warriors are on guard at the same moment (which can be non-integer), there must be at least one color which is worn by exactly one warrior.

So the task is to determine the minimum number of colors required and assign a color $$$c_i$$$ to each warrior's segment $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ such that, for every (real) time $$$t$$$ contained in at least one segment, there exists one color which belongs to exactly one segment containing $$$t$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of warriors stationed by Simurgh.
- The next $$$n$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the start and end times of the warrior's watch segment.

The sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case:

- Output the minimum number of colors $$$k$$$ needed.
- Then, output a line of $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq c_i \leq k$$$), where each $$$c_i$$$ is the color assigned to the $$$i$$$-th warrior.

61,"Problem: Rayan makes his final efforts to win Reyhaneh's heart by claiming he is stronger than Rayaneh (i.e., computer in Persian). To test this, Reyhaneh asks Khwarizmi for help. Khwarizmi explains that a set is integer linearly independent if no element in the set can be written as an integer linear combination of the others. Rayan is given a set of integers each time and must identify one of the largest possible integer linearly independent subsets.

Note that a single element is always considered an integer linearly independent subset.

An integer linearly combination of $$$a_1, \ldots, a_k$$$ is any sum of the form $$$c_1 \cdot a_1 + c_2 \cdot a_2 + \ldots + c_k \cdot a_k$$$ where $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$$$ are integers (which may be zero, positive, or negative).

The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$), the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$), the size of the set. The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5$$$).

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^6$$$.

62,"Problem: There is a team of $$$n$$$ software engineers numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Their boss promises to give them a bonus if they complete an additional project. The project requires $$$k$$$ units of work in total. The bonus promised to the $$$i$$$-th engineer is $$$a_i$$$ burles. The boss doesn't assign specific tasks to engineers; it is expected that every engineer will voluntarily complete some integer amount of work units. The bonus will be paid to the entire team only if the project is completed; in other words, if the total amount of voluntary work units on the project is greater than or equal to $$$k$$$.

The amount of work that can be performed by each engineer is not limited. However, all engineers value their labour. The $$$i$$$-th engineer estimates one unit of their work as $$$b_i$$$ burles. If the bonus is paid, the benefit $$$s_i$$$ of the $$$i$$$-th engineer for completing $$$c$$$ units of work is defined as $$$s_i = a_i - c \cdot b_i$$$. If the bonus is not paid, the engineer will not volunteer to do any work.

Engineers work together for many years, so they know how the bonus is going to be distributed and how much their colleagues value the labour. That is, all $$$a_i$$$ and all $$$b_i$$$ are known to every engineer in the team.

Engineers are eager to get the bonus, so they agreed on the following process of work distribution between them:

- the first engineer says: ""I will complete $$$c_1$$$ units of work"", where $$$c_1$$$ is a non-negative integer;
- then, the second engineer says: ""I will complete $$$c_2$$$ units of work"", where $$$c_2$$$ is a non-negative integer;
- ... and so on;
- finally, the $$$n$$$-th engineer says: ""I will complete $$$c_n$$$ units of work"", where $$$c_n$$$ is a non-negative integer.

Every engineer voices $$$c_i$$$ in a way to maximize their own benefit $$$s_i$$$. If the expected benefit is going to be zero, an engineer will still agree to work to get the experience and to help their colleagues obtain the bonus. However, if the benefit is expected to be negative for some reason (an engineer needs to perform an excessive amount of work or the project is not going to be completed), that engineer will not work at all (completes zero amount of work units).

Given that every engineer acts perfectly, your task is to find out the numbers $$$c_i$$$ voiced by every engineer.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 10^6$$$) — the number of engineers in the company and the number of work units the project requires, respectively.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the bonus which will be paid to the $$$i$$$-th engineer if the project is completed.

The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 1000$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ is the work unit cost for the $$$i$$$-th engineer.

Print $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \le c_i \le k$$$) — the amount of work completed by each engineer given that every engineer behaves optimally. Note that the answer is unique.

66,"Problem: Suppose you have $$$n$$$ water barrels standing in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

All barrels are equal and have a bottom area equal to one unit, so the volume of the water inside a barrel is equal to the height of the water column. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th barrel has $$$v_i$$$ units of water.

Adjacent barrels are connected by pipes. In other words, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, barrels $$$i$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$ are connected by a single horizontal pipe at height $$$h_i$$$. The widths of the pipes are negligible. These pipes allow water to flow between barrels.

Now you want to play with barrels. Your plan is to maximize the volume of the water in the first barrel by throwing clay into barrels. In one step, you can choose any barrel and throw one unit of clay into it. One unit of clay has the same volume as one unit of water. Clay is heavier than water and doesn't mix with it, so it falls to the bottom of the barrel, distributing evenly.

Clay has a sticky structure, so it seals pipes if the clay column is high enough. More formally, suppose the pipe is at height $$$h$$$. If the height of the clay column is also $$$\boldsymbol{h}$$$ (or lower), the pipe is working. But the moment you add more clay into the barrel, the pipe becomes sealed instantly, preventing any water from moving between barrels.

You have a mountain of clay, so you can repeat the step described above any number of times. However, between the steps, you have to wait until the water reaches the new equilibrium.

What is the maximum water volume you can collect in the first barrel?

Assume that the barrels are high enough, so the water doesn't overflow, and the pipe widths are negligible.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of barrels.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$$$ ($$$0 \le v_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$v_i$$$ is the initial water volume in the $$$i$$$-th barrel.

The third line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_{n - 1}$$$ ($$$1 \le h_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the height of the pipe between the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$(i + 1)$$$-st barrel.

Additional constraint on the input: the given water heights are in an equilibrium.

Print a single number — the maximum volume of water in the first barrel. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.

Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$$$.

67,"Problem: Suppose you are working in the Ministry of Digital Development of Berland, and your task is to monitor the industry of video blogging.

There are $$$n$$$ bloggers in Berland. Recently, due to the poor state of the main video platform in Berland, two alternative platforms were introduced. That's why bloggers started to reupload their videos to these alternative platforms. You've got the statistics that the $$$i$$$-th blogger uploaded $$$v_i$$$ videos to the first alternative platform and $$$r_i$$$ videos to the second alternative platform.

You think that a potential user will be upset if even at least one of his favorite bloggers doesn't upload anything. However, if a blogger uploads videos to both platforms, the user will watch that blogger on the platform where more videos are available. So, you've come up with the following function to estimate user experience. Suppose a user watches $$$k$$$ bloggers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k$$$; then, let user experience be $$$$$$E(b_1, \dots, b_k) = \max\left(\min_{i=1..k}{v[b_i]}, \min_{i=1..k}{r[b_i]}\right).$$$$$$

Similar to biathlon being a competition of two sports, polyathlon is a competition of many sports. This year, there are $$$m$$$ sports. Also, there are $$$n$$$ participants in the event. The sports are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, and the participants are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.

Some participants are skilled in multiple sports. You are given a binary matrix $$$n \times m$$$ such that the $$$j$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th row is 1 if the $$$i$$$-th participant is skilled in the $$$j$$$-th sport, and 0, otherwise. It's also known that, for each pair of participants, there exists at least one sport such that one of them is skilled in that sport and the other one isn't.

The order of sports in the competition is determined at the opening ceremony. Historically, it's done by the almighty Random Number Generator. A random number $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ is rolled. The competition then starts with the sport $$$x$$$, then the sport $$$(x \bmod m + 1)$$$ is played, then the sport $$$((x + 1) \bmod m + 1)$$$, and so on.

Each sport is played as follows. If all remaining participants (all participants which are not eliminated yet) are not skilled in that sport, everyone goes through to the next sport. Otherwise, all skilled participants go through to the next sport, and all unskilled participants are eliminated from the competition. Once there is a single participant remaining in the competition, the competition ends, and that participant is declared the winner.

As an organizer of the competition, you are curious of the possible outcomes of the competition beforehand (not that you are going to rig the random roll, how could you possibly think that...). For each sport $$$x$$$, print the index of the winner if the competition starts with the sport $$$x$$$.

Input and Output Format:

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a binary string consisting of exactly $$$m$$$ characters 0 or 1 — the skillset of the $$$i$$$-th participant. If the $$$j$$$-th character is 1, the $$$i$$$-th participant is skilled in the $$$j$$$-th sport. If it's 0, the $$$i$$$-th participant is not skilled in the $$$j$$$-th sport.

Additional constraint on the input: for each pair of participants, there exists at least one sport such that one of them is skilled in that sport and the other one isn't. In other words, all $$$n$$$ binary strings are pairwise distinct.

73,"Problem: Recently, Monocarp started working as a director of a park located near his house. The park is quite large, so it even has a small river splitting it into several zones. Several bridges are built across this river. Three of these bridges are especially old and need to be repaired.

All three bridges have the same length but differ in width. Their widths are $$$18$$$, $$$21$$$ and $$$25$$$ units, respectively.

During the park renovation process, Monocarp has to replace the old planks that served as the surface of the bridges with the new ones.

Planks are sold with a standard length of $$$60$$$ units. Monocarp already knows that he needs $$$n$$$ planks for each bridge. But since the bridges have different widths, he needs $$$n$$$ planks of length $$$18$$$ for the first bridge, $$$n$$$ planks of length $$$21$$$ for the second one, and $$$n$$$ planks of length $$$25$$$ for the last one.

Workers in charge of renovation have no problem with cutting planks into parts but refuse to join planks, since it creates weak spots and looks ugly.

Monocarp wants to buy as few planks as possible but struggles to calculate the required number of planks. Can you help him?

Input and Output Format:
The first and only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$) — the number of planks required for each of the three bridges.

74,"Problem: Consider the following game. There is a deck, which consists of cards of $$$n$$$ different suits. For each suit, there are $$$13$$$ cards in the deck, all with different ranks (the ranks are $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, ..., $$$10$$$, Jack, Queen, King and Ace).

Initially, the deck is shuffled randomly (all $$$(13n)!$$$ possible orders of cards have the same probability). You draw $$$5$$$ topmost cards from the deck. Then, every turn of the game, the following events happen, in the given order:

1. if the cards in your hand form a Royal Flush (a $$$10$$$, a Jack, a Queen, a King, and an Ace, all of the same suit), you win, and the game ends;
2. if you haven't won yet, and the deck is empty, you lose, and the game ends;
3. if the game hasn't ended yet, you may choose any cards from your hand (possibly, all of them) and discard them. When a card is discarded, it is removed from the game;
4. finally, you draw cards from the deck, until you have $$$5$$$ cards or the deck becomes empty.

Your goal is to find a strategy that allows you to win in the minimum expected number of turns. Note that the turn when the game ends is not counted (for example, if the $$$5$$$ cards you draw initially already form a Royal Flush, you win in $$$0$$$ turns).

Calculate the minimum possible expected number of turns required to win the game.

77,"Problem: Alice and Bob play a game. There are $$$n$$$ marbles, the $$$i$$$-th of them has color $$$c_i$$$. The players take turns; Alice goes first, then Bob, then Alice again, then Bob again, and so on.

During their turn, a player must take one of the remaining marbles and remove it from the game. If there are no marbles left (all $$$n$$$ marbles have been taken), the game ends.

Alice's score at the end of the game is calculated as follows:

- she receives $$$1$$$ point for every color $$$x$$$ such that she has taken at least one marble of that color;
- additionally, she receives $$$1$$$ point for every color $$$x$$$ such that she has taken all marbles of that color (of course, only colors present in the game are considered).

For example, suppose there are $$$5$$$ marbles, their colors are $$$[1, 3, 1, 3, 4]$$$, and the game goes as follows: Alice takes the $$$1$$$-st marble, then Bob takes the $$$3$$$-rd marble, then Alice takes the $$$5$$$-th marble, then Bob takes the $$$2$$$-nd marble, and finally, Alice takes the $$$4$$$-th marble. Then, Alice receives $$$4$$$ points: $$$3$$$ points for having at least one marble for colors $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, and $$$1$$$ point for having all marbles of color $$$4$$$. Note that this strategy is not necessarily optimal for both players.

Alice wants to maximize her score at the end of the game. Bob wants to minimize it. Both players play optimally (i. e. Alice chooses a strategy which allows her to get as many points as possible, and Bob chooses a strategy which minimizes the amount of points Alice can get).

78,"Problem: Alice and Bob participate in a fishing contest! In total, they caught $$$n$$$ fishes, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (the bigger the fish, the greater its index). Some of these fishes were caught by Alice, others — by Bob.

Their performance will be evaluated as follows. First, an integer $$$m$$$ will be chosen, and all fish will be split into $$$m$$$ non-empty groups. The first group should contain several (at least one) smallest fishes, the second group — several (at least one) next smallest fishes, and so on. Each fish should belong to exactly one group, and each group should be a contiguous subsegment of fishes. Note that the groups are numbered in exactly that order; for example, the fishes from the second group cannot be smaller than the fishes from the first group, since the first group contains the smallest fishes.

Then, each fish will be assigned a value according to its group index: each fish in the first group gets value equal to $$$0$$$, each fish in the second group gets value equal to $$$1$$$, and so on. So, each fish in the $$$i$$$-th group gets value equal to $$$(i-1)$$$.

The score of each contestant is simply the total value of all fishes that contestant caught.

You want Bob's score to exceed Alice's score by at least $$$k$$$ points. What is the minimum number of groups ($$$m$$$) you have to split the fishes into? If it is impossible, you should report that.

105,"Problem: There are $$$2$$$ queues of patients at the doors of two doctors. The first doctor sees patients in the usual order of the queue — whoever arrived first will be seen first. The second doctor does the opposite — he sees those who arrived last first. Thus, there is a queue for the first doctor and a stack for the second doctor. A patient can be in both the queue and the stack. Each patient is characterized by the time their visit to the doctor will take (the time is the same for both doctors).

When the appointments begin, the doctors will see patients in the order of the queue and stack, respectively. As soon as a doctor finishes with one patient, he will call the next one.

But there is one problem: if a patient is in both the queue and the stack, and he is called to one doctor first and then to the other, while he has not yet finished with the first one, confusion will arise. It is allowed for a patient to go to the second doctor at the exact moment he finishes with the first doctor.

The current configuration of the queue and stack is called good if the doctors can see all the patients without any confusion arising.

Initially, both the queue and the stack are empty. There are three types of queries:

1. add patient $$$x$$$ to the queue;
2. add patient $$$x$$$ to the stack;
3. patient $$$x$$$, who was in the queue, realizes he is in the wrong place and moves to the stack; however, he moves to the position in the stack as if he had entered the stack at the moment of the query when he entered the queue.

It is guaranteed that after each query, each patient is no more than once in the queue and no more than once in the stack.

After each query, you need to determine if the current configuration is good.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of requests.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — for each patient, the time their visit to the doctor will take.

Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$t$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 3$$$; $$$1 \le x \le n$$$) — the type of query and the patient's index. It is guaranteed that:

- if the query is of type $$$1$$$, then patient $$$x$$$ is not in the queue yet;
- if the query is of type $$$2$$$, then patient $$$x$$$ is not in the stack yet;
- if the query is of type $$$3$$$, then patient $$$x$$$ is in the queue already and not in the stack yet.

After each query, print ""YES"", if the current configuration is good, and ""NO"" otherwise.

Each cell contains an integer; initially, the integer in the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is $$$a_{i,j}$$$.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

- choose two columns and swap them (i. e. choose two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$1 \le x < y \le n$$$, then swap $$$a_{1,x}$$$ with $$$a_{1,y}$$$, and then swap $$$a_{2,x}$$$ with $$$a_{2,y}$$$).

After performing the operations, you have to choose a path from the cell $$$(1,1)$$$ to the cell $$$(2,n)$$$. For every cell $$$(i,j)$$$ in the path except for the last, the next cell should be either $$$(i+1,j)$$$ or $$$(i,j+1)$$$. Obviously, the path cannot go outside the matrix.

The cost of the path is the sum of all integers in all $$$(n+1)$$$ cells belonging to the path. You have to perform the operations and choose a path so that its cost is maximum possible.

108,"Problem: Once, four Roman merchants met in a Roman mansion to discuss their trading plans. They faced the following problem: they traded the same type of goods, and if they traded in the same city, they would inevitably incur losses. They decided to divide up the cities between them where they would trade.

The map of Rome can be represented in this problem as a plane with certain points marked — the cities of the Roman Empire.

The merchants decided to choose a certain dividing point $$$(x_0, y_0)$$$. Then, in a city with coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$,

- the first merchant sells goods if $$$x_0 \le x_i$$$ and $$$y_0 \le y_i$$$;
- the second merchant sells goods if $$$x_0 > x_i$$$ and $$$y_0 \le y_i$$$;
- the third merchant sells goods if $$$x_0 \le x_i$$$ and $$$y_0 > y_i$$$;

For a long time, no one could decipher Sumerian cuneiform. However, it has finally succumbed to pressure! Today, you have the chance to decipher Yandex cuneiform.

Yandex cuneiform is defined by the following rules:

1. An empty string is a Yandex cuneiform.
2. If you insert exactly one copy of each of the three letters 'Y', 'D', and 'X' into a Yandex cuneiform in such a way that no two adjacent letters become equal after the operation, you obtain a Yandex cuneiform.
3. If a string can't be obtained using the above rules, it is not a Yandex cuneiform.

You are given a template. A template is a string consisting of the characters 'Y', 'D', 'X', and '?'.

You need to check whether there exists a way to replace each question mark with 'Y', 'D', or 'X' to obtain a Yandex cuneiform, and if it exists, output any of the matching options, as well as a sequence of insertion operations to obtain the resulting cuneiform.

In this version of the problem, there are no question marks in the template.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing a template of length $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n < 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \bmod 3 = 0$$$), consisting only of characters 'Y', 'D', 'X'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing 'NO' if it is not possible to obtain a cuneiform from the given template.

Otherwise, output 'YES' on the first line, and on the second line, any obtainable cuneiform. After that, you need to output the sequence of operations that leads to the cuneiform you printed.

A sequence of operations is described by $$$\frac{n}{3}$$$ triples of pairs. A pair has the form c p, where $$$c$$$ is one of the letters 'Y', 'D', or 'X', and $$$p$$$ is the position at which the letter $$$c$$$ should be inserted. The insertion position is the number of letters to skip from the beginning of the string for the insertion. For example, after inserting the character 'D' into the string ""YDX"" with $$$p=3$$$, the result is ""YDXD"", and with $$$p=0$$$, it is ""DYDX"". Note that the index cannot exceed the current length of the string.

The operations are applied from top to bottom, left to right. After inserting each triple to the string, there should be no two adjacent identical characters.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing a template of length $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n < 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \bmod 3 = 0$$$), consisting only of characters 'Y', 'D', 'X', and '?'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing 'NO' if it is not possible to obtain a cuneiform from the given template.

Otherwise, output 'YES' on the first line, and on the second line, any obtainable cuneiform. After that, you need to output the sequence of operations that leads to the cuneiform you printed.

A sequence of operations is described by $$$\frac{n}{3}$$$ triples of pairs. A pair has the form c p, where $$$c$$$ is one of the letters 'Y', 'D', or 'X', and $$$p$$$ is the position at which the letter $$$c$$$ should be inserted. The insertion position is the number of letters to skip from the beginning of the string for the insertion. For example, after inserting the character 'D' into the string ""YDX"" with $$$p=3$$$, the result is ""YDXD"", and with $$$p=0$$$, it is ""DYDX"". Note that the index cannot exceed the current length of the string.

The operations are applied from top to bottom, left to right. After inserting each triple to the string, there should be no two adjacent identical characters.

114,"Problem: Alice has $$$a$$$ coins. She can open a bank deposit called ""Profitable"", but the minimum amount required to open this deposit is $$$b$$$ coins.

There is also a deposit called ""Unprofitable"", which can be opened with any amount of coins. Alice noticed that if she opens the ""Unprofitable"" deposit with $$$x$$$ coins, the minimum amount required to open the ""Profitable"" deposit decreases by $$$2x$$$ coins. However, these coins cannot later be deposited into the ""Profitable"" deposit.

Help Alice determine the maximum number of coins she can deposit into the ""Profitable"" deposit if she first deposits some amount of coins (possibly $$$0$$$) into the ""Unprofitable"" deposit. If Alice can never open the ""Profitable"" deposit, output $$$0$$$.

115,"Problem: There is a vending machine that sells lemonade. The machine has a total of $$$n$$$ slots. You know that initially, the $$$i$$$-th slot contains $$$a_i$$$ cans of lemonade. There are also $$$n$$$ buttons on the machine, each button corresponds to a slot, with exactly one button corresponding to each slot. Unfortunately, the labels on the buttons have worn off, so you do not know which button corresponds to which slot.

When you press the button corresponding to the $$$i$$$-th slot, one of two events occurs:

- If there is a can of lemonade in the $$$i$$$-th slot, it will drop out and you will take it. At this point, the number of cans in the $$$i$$$-th slot decreases by $$$1$$$.
- If there are no cans of lemonade left in the $$$i$$$-th slot, nothing will drop out.

After pressing, the can drops out so quickly that it is impossible to track from which slot it fell. The contents of the slots are hidden from your view, so you cannot see how many cans are left in each slot. The only thing you know is the initial number of cans in the slots: $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.

Determine the minimum number of button presses needed to guarantee that you receive at least $$$k$$$ cans of lemonade.

Note that you can adapt your strategy during the button presses based on whether you received a can or not. It is guaranteed that there are at least $$$k$$$ cans of lemonade in total in the machine. In other words, $$$k \leq a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the number of cans in the slots.

It is guaranteed that $$$k \leq a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n$$$, meaning there are at least $$$k$$$ cans of lemonade in the machine.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

131,"Problem: Sakurako really loves alternating strings. She calls a string $$$s$$$ of lowercase Latin letters an alternating string if characters in the even positions are the same, if characters in the odd positions are the same, and the length of the string is even.

For example, the strings 'abab' and 'gg' are alternating, while the strings 'aba' and 'ggwp' are not.

As a good friend, you decided to gift such a string, but you couldn't find one. Luckily, you can perform two types of operations on the string:

1. Choose an index $$$i$$$ and delete the $$$i$$$-th character from the string, which will reduce the length of the string by $$$1$$$. This type of operation can be performed no more than $$$1$$$ time;
2. Choose an index $$$i$$$ and replace $$$s_i$$$ with any other letter.

Since you are in a hurry, you need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the string an alternating one.

Two players take turns choosing a non-empty pile and removing any positive (strictly greater than $$$0$$$) number of stones from it. The player unable to make a move loses the game.

You are given an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Artem and Ruslan decided to play Nim on segments of this array. Each of the $$$q$$$ rounds is defined by a segment $$$(l_i, r_i)$$$, where the elements $$$a_{l_i}, a_{l_i+1}, \dots, a_{r_i}$$$ represent the sizes of the piles of stones.

Before the game starts, Ruslan can remove any number of piles from the chosen segment. However, at least one pile must remain, so in a single round he can remove at most $$$(r_i - l_i)$$$ piles. He is allowed to remove $$$0$$$ piles. After the removal, the game is played on the remaining piles within the segment.

All rounds are independent: the changes made in one round do not affect the original array or any other rounds.

Ruslan wants to remove as many piles as possible so that Artem, who always makes the first move, loses.

For each round, determine:

1. the maximum number of piles Ruslan can remove;
2. the number of ways to choose the maximum number of piles for removal.

Two ways are considered different if there exists an index $$$i$$$ such that the pile at index $$$i$$$ is removed in one way but not in the other. Since the number of ways can be large, output it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

If Ruslan cannot ensure Artem's loss in a particular round, output -1 for that round.

145,"Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. In the two versions, the constraints on $$$q$$$ and the time limit are different. In this version, $$$0 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.

A team consisting of $$$n$$$ members, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, is set to present a slide show at a large meeting. The slide show contains $$$m$$$ slides.

There is an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Initially, the members are standing in a line in the order of $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ from front to back. The slide show will be presented in order from slide $$$1$$$ to slide $$$m$$$. Each section will be presented by the member at the front of the line. After each slide is presented, you can move the member at the front of the line to any position in the lineup (without changing the order of the rest of the members). For example, suppose the line of members is $$$[\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$$$. After member $$$3$$$ presents the current slide, you can change the line of members into either $$$[\color{red}{3},1,2,4]$$$, $$$[1,\color{red}{3},2,4]$$$, $$$[1,2,\color{red}{3},4]$$$ or $$$[1,2,4,\color{red}{3}]$$$.

There is also an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$. The slide show is considered good if it is possible to make member $$$b_i$$$ present slide $$$i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ under these constraints.

However, your annoying boss wants to make $$$q$$$ updates to the array $$$b$$$. In the $$$i$$$-th update, he will choose a slide $$$s_i$$$ and a member $$$t_i$$$ and set $$$b_{s_i} := t_i$$$. Note that these updates are persistent, that is changes made to the array $$$b$$$ will apply when processing future updates.

For each of the $$$q+1$$$ states of array $$$b$$$, the initial state and after each of the $$$q$$$ updates, determine if the slideshow is good.

146,"Problem: Pak Chanek has a friend who runs a drink stall in a canteen. His friend will sell drinks for $$$n$$$ days, numbered from day $$$1$$$ to day $$$n$$$. There are also $$$m$$$ types of drinks, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$.

The profit gained from selling a drink on a particular day can vary. On day $$$i$$$, the projected profit from selling drink of type $$$j$$$ is $$$A_{i, j}$$$. Note that $$$A_{i, j}$$$ can be negative, meaning that selling the drink would actually incur a loss.

Pak Chanek wants to help his friend plan the sales over the $$$n$$$ days. On day $$$i$$$, Pak Chanek must choose to sell at least one type of drink. Furthermore, the types of drinks sold on a single day must form a subarray. In other words, in each day, Pak Chanek will select $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \leq i \leq j \leq m$$$. Then all types of drinks between $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ (inclusive) will be sold.

However, to ensure that customers from the previous day keep returning, the selection of drink types sold on day $$$i$$$ ($$$i>1$$$) must meet the following conditions:

- At least one drink type sold on day $$$i$$$ must also have been sold on day $$$i-1$$$.
- At least one drink type sold on day $$$i$$$ must not have been sold on day $$$i-1$$$.

The daily profit is the sum of the profits from all drink types sold on that day. The total profit from the sales plan is the sum of the profits over $$$n$$$ days. What is the maximum total profit that can be achieved if Pak Chanek plans the sales optimally?

152,"Problem: This is a simplified version of the problem. It differs from the difficult one only in its constraints.

At the Berland State University, the local network between servers does not always operate without errors. When transmitting two identical messages consecutively, an error may occur, resulting in the two messages merging into one. In this merging, the end of the first message coincides with the beginning of the second. Of course, the merging can only occur at identical characters. The length of the merging must be a positive number less than the length of the message text.

For example, when transmitting two messages ""abrakadabra"" consecutively, it is possible that it will be transmitted with the described type of error, resulting in a message like ""abrakadabrabrakadabra"" or ""abrakadabrakadabra' (in the first case, the merging occurred at one character, and in the second case, at four).

Given the received message t, determine if it is possible that this is the result of an error of the described type in the operation of the local network, and if so, determine a possible value of s.

A situation where two messages completely overlap each other should not be considered an error. For example, if the received message is ""abcd"", it should be considered that there is no error in it. Similarly, simply appending one message after another is not a sign of an error. For instance, if the received message is ""abcabc"", it should also be considered that there is no error in it.

Input and Output Format:
The input consists of a single non-empty string t, consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. The length of the string t does not exceed 100 characters.

The travel network is represented as $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ edges. The $$$i$$$-th edge connects vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, and takes $$$w_i$$$ seconds to travel (all $$$w_i$$$ are even). Marian starts at vertex $$$1$$$ (Market) and Robin starts at vertex $$$n$$$ (Major Oak).

In addition, $$$h$$$ of the $$$n$$$ vertices each has a single horse available. Both Marian and Robin are capable riders, and could mount horses in no time (i.e. in $$$0$$$ seconds). Travel times are halved when riding. Once mounted, a horse lasts the remainder of the travel. Meeting must take place on a vertex (i.e. not on an edge). Either could choose to wait on any vertex.

161,"Problem: The folk hero Robin Hood has been troubling Sheriff of Nottingham greatly. Sheriff knows that Robin Hood is about to attack his camps and he wants to be prepared.

Sheriff of Nottingham built the camps with strategy in mind and thus there are exactly $$$n$$$ camps numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$n-1$$$ trails, each connecting two camps. Any camp can be reached from any other camp. Each camp $$$i$$$ has initially $$$a_i$$$ gold.

As it is now, all camps would be destroyed by Robin. Sheriff can strengthen a camp by subtracting exactly $$$c$$$ gold from each of its neighboring camps and use it to build better defenses for that camp. Strengthening a camp doesn't change its gold, only its neighbors' gold. A camp can have negative gold.

After Robin Hood's attack, all camps that have been strengthened survive the attack, all others are destroyed.

What's the maximum gold Sheriff can keep in his surviving camps after Robin Hood's attack if he strengthens his camps optimally?

Camp $$$a$$$ is neighboring camp $$$b$$$ if and only if there exists a trail connecting $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. Only strengthened camps count towards the answer, as others are destroyed.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case begins with two integers $$$n$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le c \le 10^9$$$) — the number of camps and the gold taken from each neighboring camp for strengthening.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the initial gold of each camp.

Then follow $$$n-1$$$ lines, each with integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$u \ne v$$$) — meaning that there is a trail between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$.

It is guaranteed that any camp is reachable from any other camp.

163,"Problem: Sheriff of Nottingham has organized a tournament in archery. It's the final round and Robin Hood is playing against Sheriff!

There are $$$n$$$ targets in a row numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. When a player shoots target $$$i$$$, their score increases by $$$a_i$$$ and the target $$$i$$$ is destroyed. The game consists of turns and players alternate between whose turn it is. Robin Hood always starts the game, then Sheriff and so on. The game continues until all targets are destroyed. Both players start with score $$$0$$$.

At the end of the game, the player with most score wins and the other player loses. If both players have the same score, it's a tie and no one wins or loses. In each turn, the player can shoot any target that wasn't shot before. Both play optimally to get the most score possible.

Sheriff of Nottingham has a suspicion that he might lose the game! This cannot happen, you must help Sheriff. Sheriff will pose $$$q$$$ queries, each specifying $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. This means that the game would be played only with targets $$$l, l+1, \dots, r$$$, as others would be removed by Sheriff before the game starts.

For each query $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, determine whether the Sheriff can not lose the game when only considering the targets $$$l, l+1, \dots, r$$$.

During each subsequent turn, Monocarp can take exactly one card that has either the same number as on the card taken on the previous turn or a number that is one greater than the number on the card taken on the previous turn.

In other words, if on the previous turn Monocarp took a card with the number $$$x$$$, then on the current turn he can take either a card with the number $$$x$$$ or a card with the number $$$x + 1$$$. Monocarp can take any card which meets that condition, regardless of its position in the deck.

172,"Problem: You have a binary string$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and Iris gives you another binary string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n-1$$$.

Iris is going to play a game with you. During the game, you will perform $$$n-1$$$ operations on $$$s$$$. In the $$$i$$$-th operation ($$$1 \le i \le n-1$$$):

- First, you choose an index $$$k$$$ such that $$$1\le k\le |s| - 1$$$ and $$$s_{k} \neq s_{k+1}$$$. If it is impossible to choose such an index, you lose;
- Then, you replace $$$s_ks_{k+1}$$$ with $$$r_i$$$. Note that this decreases the length of $$$s$$$ by $$$1$$$.

If all the $$$n-1$$$ operations are performed successfully, you win.

177,"Problem: There is an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Initially, all elements of $$$a$$$ are equal to $$$0$$$.

Kevin can perform several operations on the array. Each operation is one of the following two types:

- Prefix addition — Kevin first selects an index $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le x\le n$$$), and then for each $$$1\le j\le x$$$, increases $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$;
- Suffix addition — Kevin first selects an index $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le x\le n$$$), and then for each $$$x\le j\le n$$$, increases $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$.

In the country of KDOI, people think that the integer $$$v$$$ is balanced. Thus, Iris gives Kevin an array $$$c$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers and defines the beauty of the array $$$a$$$ as follows:

- Initially, set $$$b=0$$$;
- For each $$$1\le i\le n$$$, if $$$a_i=v$$$, add $$$c_i$$$ to $$$b$$$;
- The beauty of $$$a$$$ is the final value of $$$b$$$.

Kevin wants to maximize the beauty of $$$a$$$ after all the operations. However, he had already performed $$$m$$$ operations when he was sleepy. Now, he can perform an arbitrary number (possibly zero) of new operations.

You have to help Kevin find the maximum possible beauty if he optimally performs the new operations.

183,"Problem: You are given a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ with $$$n$$$ nodes and values $$$l_i, r_i$$$ for each node. You can choose an initial value $$$a_i$$$ satisfying $$$l_i\le a_i\le r_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th node. A tree is balanced if all node values are equal, and the value of a balanced tree is defined as the value of any node.

In one operation, you can choose two nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and increase the values of all nodes in the subtree$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of node $$$v$$$ by $$$1$$$ while considering $$$u$$$ as the root of the entire tree. Note that $$$u$$$ may be equal to $$$v$$$.

Your goal is to perform a series of operations so that the tree becomes balanced. Find the minimum possible value of the tree after performing these operations. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of input test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.

Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$l_i,r_i$$$ ($$$0\le l_i \le r_i\le 10^9$$$) — the constraint of the value of the $$$i$$$-th node.

The next $$$n-1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i,v_i$$$ ($$$1\le u_i,v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$) — an edge connecting $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible value that all $$$a_i$$$ can be made equal to after performing the operations. It can be shown that the answer always exists.

There are $$$n$$$ stars in the sky, arranged in a row. Iris has a telescope, which she uses to look at the stars.

Initially, Iris observes stars in the segment $$$[1, n]$$$, and she has a lucky value of $$$0$$$. Iris wants to look for the star in the middle position for each segment $$$[l, r]$$$ that she observes. So the following recursive procedure is used:

- First, she will calculate $$$m = \left\lfloor \frac{l+r}{2} \right\rfloor$$$.
- If the length of the segment (i.e. $$$r - l + 1$$$) is even, Iris will divide it into two equally long segments $$$[l, m]$$$ and $$$[m+1, r]$$$ for further observation.
- Otherwise, Iris will aim the telescope at star $$$m$$$, and her lucky value will increase by $$$m$$$; subsequently, if $$$l \neq r$$$, Iris will continue to observe two segments $$$[l, m-1]$$$ and $$$[m+1, r]$$$.

Iris is a bit lazy. She defines her laziness by an integer $$$k$$$: as the observation progresses, she will not continue to observe any segment $$$[l, r]$$$ with a length strictly less than $$$k$$$. In this case, please predict her final lucky value.

- Iris is interested in the largest possible value of $$$P = \prod\limits_{i=1}^n \min(a_i, b_i)$$$ after an arbitrary rearrangement of $$$b$$$. Note that she only wants to know the maximum value of $$$P$$$, and no actual rearrangement is performed on $$$b$$$.
- There will be $$$q$$$ modifications. Each modification can be denoted by two integers $$$o$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$o$$$ is either $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$, $$$1 \leq x \leq n$$$). If $$$o = 1$$$, then Iris will increase $$$a_x$$$ by $$$1$$$; otherwise, she will increase $$$b_x$$$ by $$$1$$$.
- Iris asks Chris the maximum value of $$$P$$$ for $$$q + 1$$$ times: once before any modification, then after every modification.
- Since $$$P$$$ might be huge, Chris only needs to calculate it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Chris soon worked out this problem, but he was so tired that he fell asleep. Besides saying thanks to Chris, now it is your turn to write a program to calculate the answers for given input data.

193,"Problem: There is a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Let a caterpillar be denoted by an integer pair $$$(p, q)$$$ ($$$1 \leq p, q \leq n$$$, $$$p \neq q$$$): its head is at vertex $$$p$$$, its tail is at vertex $$$q$$$, and it dominates all the vertices on the simple path from $$$p$$$ to $$$q$$$ (including $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$). The caterpillar sequence of $$$(p, q)$$$ is defined as the sequence consisting only of the vertices on the simple path, sorted in the ascending order of the distance to $$$p$$$.

Nora and Aron are taking turns moving the caterpillar, with Nora going first. Both players will be using his or her own optimal strategy:

- They will play to make himself or herself win;
- However, if it is impossible, they will play to prevent the other person from winning (thus, the game will end in a tie).

In Nora's turn, she must choose a vertex $$$u$$$ adjacent to vertex $$$p$$$, which is not dominated by the caterpillar, and move all the vertices in it by one edge towards vertex $$$u$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$. In Aron's turn, he must choose a vertex $$$v$$$ adjacent to vertex $$$q$$$, which is not dominated by the caterpillar, and move all the vertices in it by one edge towards vertex $$$v$$$. Note that the moves allowed to the two players are different.

Whenever $$$p$$$ is a leaf$$$^{\text{†}}$$$, Nora wins$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$. Whenever $$$q$$$ is a leaf, Aron wins. If either initially both $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are leaves, or after $$$10^{100}$$$ turns the game has not ended, the result is a tie.

Please count the number of integer pairs $$$(p, q)$$$ with $$$1 \leq p, q \leq n$$$ and $$$p \neq q$$$ such that, if the caterpillar is initially $$$(p, q)$$$, Aron wins the game.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 2\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The following $$$n - 1$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$), denoting an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of integer pairs $$$(p, q)$$$ which make Aron win.

The heights of the monument's pillars can be represented as an array $$$h$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers, where $$$h_i$$$ represents the height of the $$$i$$$-th pillar for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$.

Penchick wants the heights of the pillars to be in non-decreasing order, i.e. $$$h_i \le h_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n - 1$$$. However, due to confusion, the monument was built such that the heights of the pillars are in non-increasing order instead, i.e. $$$h_i \ge h_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n - 1$$$.

Luckily, Penchick can modify the monument and do the following operation on the pillars as many times as necessary:

- Modify the height of a pillar to any positive integer. Formally, choose an index $$$1\le i\le n$$$ and a positive integer $$$x$$$. Then, assign $$$h_i := x$$$.

216,"Problem: As a computer science student, Alex faces a hard challenge — showering. He tries to shower daily, but despite his best efforts there are always challenges. He takes $$$s$$$ minutes to shower and a day only has $$$m$$$ minutes!

He already has $$$n$$$ tasks planned for the day. Task $$$i$$$ is represented as an interval $$$(l_i$$$, $$$r_i)$$$, which means that Alex is busy and can not take a shower in that time interval (at any point in time strictly between $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$). No two tasks overlap.

Given all $$$n$$$ time intervals, will Alex be able to shower that day? In other words, will Alex have a free time interval of length at least $$$s$$$?

In the first test case, Alex can shower for the first $$$3$$$ minutes of the day and not miss any of the tasks.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \leq s, m \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of time intervals Alex already has planned, the amount of time Alex takes to take a shower, and the amount of minutes a day has.

Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq l_i < r_i \leq m$$$) — the time interval of the $$$i$$$-th task. No two tasks overlap.

Additional constraint on the input: $$$l_i > r_{i-1}$$$ for every $$$i > 1$$$.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case output ""YES"" (without quotes) if Alex can take a shower for that given test case, and ""NO"" (also without quotes) otherwise.

229,"Problem: Ksyusha decided to start a game development company. To stand out among competitors and achieve success, she decided to write her own game engine. The engine must support a set initially consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.

The set will undergo $$$m$$$ operations sequentially. The operations can be of the following types:

- Insert element $$$x$$$ into the set;
- Remove element $$$x$$$ from the set;
- Report the $$$k$$$-load of the set.

The $$$k$$$-load of the set is defined as the minimum positive integer $$$d$$$ such that the integers $$$d, d + 1, \ldots, d + (k - 1)$$$ do not appear in this set. For example, the $$$3$$$-load of the set $$$\{3, 4, 6, 11\}$$$ is $$$7$$$, since the integers $$$7, 8, 9$$$ are absent from the set, and no smaller value fits.

Ksyusha is busy with management tasks, so you will have to write the engine. Implement efficient support for the described operations.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The following lines describe the test cases.

The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the initial size of the set.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the initial state of the set.

The third line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of operations.

The next $$$m$$$ lines contain the operations. The operations are given in the following format:

- + $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — insert element $$$x$$$ into the set (it is guaranteed that $$$x$$$ is not in the set);
- - $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — remove element $$$x$$$ from the set (it is guaranteed that $$$x$$$ is in the set);
- ? $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — output the value of the $$$k$$$-load of the set.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$, and the same holds for $$$m$$$.

For each test case, output the answers to the operations of type ""?"".

His task is to arrange the numbers $$$0, 1, \ldots, n \cdot m - 1$$$ in the table (each number must be used exactly once) in such a way as to maximize the sum of MEX$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ across all rows and columns. More formally, he needs to maximize $$$$$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \operatorname{mex}(\{a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \ldots, a_{i,m}\}) + \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{m} \operatorname{mex}(\{a_{1,j}, a_{2,j}, \ldots, a_{n,j}\}),$$$$$$ where $$$a_{i,j}$$$ is the number in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column.

238,"Problem: There are very long classes in the T-Generation. In one day, you need to have time to analyze the training and thematic contests, give a lecture with new material, and, if possible, also hold a mini-seminar. Therefore, there is a break where students can go to drink coffee and chat with each other.

There are a total of $$$n+2$$$ coffee machines located in sequentially arranged rooms along a long corridor. The coffee machines are numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n+1$$$, and immediately after the break starts, there are $$$a_i$$$ students gathered around the $$$i$$$-th coffee machine.

The students are talking too loudly among themselves, and the teachers need to make a very important announcement. Therefore, they want to gather the maximum number of students around some single coffee machine. The teachers are too lazy to run around the corridors and gather the students, so they came up with a more sophisticated way to manipulate them:

- At any moment, the teachers can choose room $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) and turn off the lights there;
- If there were $$$x$$$ students in that room, then after turning off the lights, $$$\lfloor \frac12 x \rfloor$$$ students will go to room $$$(i-1)$$$, and $$$\lfloor \frac12 x \rfloor$$$ other students will go to room $$$(i+1)$$$.
- If $$$x$$$ was odd, then one student remains in the same room.
- After that, the lights in room $$$i$$$ are turned back on.

The teachers have not yet decided where they will gather the students, so for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you should determine what is the maximum number of students that can be gathered around the $$$i$$$-th coffee machine.

The teachers can turn off the lights in any rooms at their discretion, in any order, possibly turning off the lights in the same room multiple times.

Note that the values of $$$a_0$$$ and $$$a_{n+1}$$$ do not affect the answer to the problem, so their values will not be given to you.

239,"Problem: This is an interactive problem.

You are given an array $$$x_1, \ldots, x_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The jury also has a fixed but hidden array $$$y_1, \ldots, y_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The elements of array $$$y$$$ are unknown to you. Additionally, it is known that for all $$$i$$$, $$$x_i \neq y_i$$$, and all pairs $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are distinct.

The jury has secretly thought of one of two objects, and you need to determine which one it is:

- Object A: A directed graph with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and with $$$n$$$ edges of the form $$$x_i \to y_i$$$.
- Object B: $$$n$$$ points on a coordinate plane. The $$$i$$$-th point has coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$.

To guess which object the jury has thought of, you can make queries. In one query, you must specify two numbers $$$i, j$$$ $$$(1 \leq i, j \leq n, i \neq j)$$$. In response, you receive one number:

- If the jury has thought of Object A, you receive the length of the shortest path (in edges) from vertex $$$i$$$ to vertex $$$j$$$ in the graph, or $$$0$$$ if there is no path.
- If the jury has thought of Object B, you receive the Manhattan distance between points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, that is $$$|x_i -x_j| + |y_i - y_j|$$$.

You have $$$2$$$ queries to determine which of the objects the jury has thought of.

244,"Problem: You have $$$n$$$ barrels of infinite capacity. The $$$i$$$-th barrel initially contains $$$a_i$$$ kilograms of water. In this problem, we assume that all barrels weigh the same.

You know that exactly one of the barrels has a small amount of tropical poison distributed on its surface, with a total weight of $$$0.179$$$ kilograms. However, you do not know which barrel contains the poison. Your task is to identify this poisonous barrel.

All the barrels are on scales. Unfortunately, the scales do not show the exact weight of each barrel. Instead, for each pair of barrels, they show the result of a comparison between the weights of those barrels. Thus, for any two barrels, you can determine whether their weights are equal, and if not, which barrel is heavier. The poison and water are included in the weight of the barrel.

The scales are always turned on, and the information from them can be used an unlimited number of times.

You also have the ability to pour water. You can pour water from any barrel into any other barrel in any amounts.

However, to pour water, you must physically handle the barrel from which you are pouring, so if that happens to be the poisonous barrel, you will die. This outcome must be avoided.

However, you can pour water into the poisonous barrel without touching it.

In other words, you can choose the numbers $$$i, j, x$$$ ($$$i \neq j, 1 \leq i, j \leq n, 0 < x \leq a_i$$$, the barrel numbered $$$i$$$ — not is poisonous) and execute $$$a_i := a_i - x$$$, $$$a_j := a_j + x$$$. Where $$$x$$$ is not necessarily an integer.

Is it possible to guarantee the identification of which barrel contains the poison and remain alive using pouring and the information from the scales? You know that the poison is located on exactly one of the barrels.

Additionally, we ask you to process $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, either one of the existing barrels is removed, or an additional barrel with a certain amount of water is added. After each query, you need to answer whether it is possible to guarantee the identification of the poisonous barrel, given that there is exactly one.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^6$$$) — the volumes of water in the existing barrels.

The next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is either of the form + x or - x, which means, respectively, adding and removing a barrel with $$$x$$$ kilograms of water. It is guaranteed that when the query - x is made, one of the existing barrels has a volume of $$$x$$$, and that there is always at least one barrel remaining throughout the queries. In all queries, $$$1 \leq x \leq 10^6$$$.

Output $$$q+1$$$ lines, the answer to the problem before all queries, and after each query. If it is possible to identify the poisonous barrel, output ""Yes""; otherwise, output ""No"". You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings ""yEs"", ""yes"", ""Yes"", and ""YES"" will be recognized as positive responses.

Specifically, these times are represented by the array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the time (in minutes) at which a chip is installed in the $$$i$$$-th room.

As soon as a chip is installed, it changes the room's light status every $$$k$$$ minutes — it turns on the light for $$$k$$$ minutes, then turns it off for the next $$$k$$$ minutes, then turns it back on for the next $$$k$$$ minutes, and so on. In other words, the light status is changed by the chip at minute $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_i + k$$$, $$$a_i + 2k$$$, $$$a_i + 3k$$$, $$$\ldots$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th room.

What is the earliest moment when all rooms in the apartment have their lights turned on?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rooms in the apartment and the period of the chips.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the moments when the chips are installed.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer — the answer to the question (in minutes). If there is no such moment that the lights are turned on in all the rooms, print $$$-1$$$ instead.

265,"Problem: Given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, and another array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers.

In one operation, you can select any subarray of size $$$k$$$ of $$$a$$$, then remove it from the array without changing the order of other elements. More formally, let $$$(l, r)$$$ be an operation on subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$ such that $$$r-l+1=k$$$, then performing this operation means replacing $$$a$$$ with $$$[a_1, \ldots, a_{l-1}, a_{r+1}, \ldots, a_n]$$$.

For example, if $$$a=[1,2,3,4,5]$$$ and we perform operation $$$(3,5)$$$ on this array, it will become $$$a=[1,2]$$$. Moreover, operation $$$(2, 4)$$$ results in $$$a=[1,5]$$$, and operation $$$(1,3)$$$ results in $$$a=[4,5]$$$.

You have to repeat the operation while the length of $$$a$$$ is greater than $$$k$$$ (which means $$$|a| \gt k$$$). What is the largest possible median$$$^\dagger$$$ of all remaining elements of the array $$$a$$$ after the process?

$$$^\dagger$$$The median of an array of length $$$n$$$ is the element whose index is $$$\left \lfloor (n+1)/2 \right \rfloor$$$ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: $$$median([2,1,5,4,3]) = 3$$$, $$$median([5]) = 5$$$, and $$$median([6,8,2,4]) = 4$$$.

266,"Problem: Given a matrix $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \times m$$$, each cell of which contains a non-negative integer. The integer lying at the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column of the matrix is called $$$a_{i,j}$$$.

Let's define $$$f(i)$$$ and $$$g(j)$$$ as the XOR of all integers in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column, respectively. In one operation, you can either:

- Select any row $$$i$$$, then assign $$$a_{i,j} := g(j)$$$ for each $$$1 \le j \le m$$$; or
- Select any column $$$j$$$, then assign $$$a_{i,j} := f(i)$$$ for each $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.

An example of applying an operation on column $$$2$$$ of the matrix.

In this example, as we apply an operation on column $$$2$$$, all elements in this column are changed:

- $$$a_{1,2} := f(1) = a_{1,1} \oplus a_{1,2} \oplus a_{1,3} \oplus a_{1,4} = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 0$$$
- $$$a_{2,2} := f(2) = a_{2,1} \oplus a_{2,2} \oplus a_{2,3} \oplus a_{2,4} = 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 5 \oplus 7 = 3$$$
- $$$a_{3,2} := f(3) = a_{3,1} \oplus a_{3,2} \oplus a_{3,3} \oplus a_{3,4} = 2 \oplus 0 \oplus 3 \oplus 0 = 1$$$
- $$$a_{4,2} := f(4) = a_{4,1} \oplus a_{4,2} \oplus a_{4,3} \oplus a_{4,4} = 10 \oplus 11 \oplus 12 \oplus 16 = 29$$$

You can apply the operations any number of times. Then, we calculate the $$$\textit{beauty}$$$ of the final matrix by summing the absolute differences between all pairs of its adjacent cells.

More formally, $$$\textit{beauty}(a) = \sum|a_{x,y} - a_{r,c}|$$$ for all cells $$$(x, y)$$$ and $$$(r, c)$$$ if they are adjacent. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.

Find the minimum $$$\textit{beauty}$$$ among all obtainable matrices.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 250$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 15$$$) — the number of rows and columns of $$$a$$$, respectively.

The next $$$n$$$ lines, each containing $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \ldots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \le a_{i,j} < 2^{20}$$$) — description of the matrix $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$(n^2 + m^2)$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

270,"Problem: Bowling is a national sport in Taiwan; everyone in the country plays the sport on a daily basis since their youth. Naturally, there are a lot of bowling alleys all over the country, and the competition between them is as intense as you can imagine.

Maw-Shang owns one such bowling alley. To stand out from other competitors in the industry and draw attention from customers, he decided to hold a special event every month that features various unorthodox bowling rules. For the event this month, he came up with a new version of the game called X-pin bowling. In the traditional $$$10$$$-pin bowling game, a frame is built out of ten bowling pins forming a triangular shape of side length four. The pin closest to the player forms the first row, and the two pins behind it form the second row, and so on. Unlike the standard version, the game of $$$X$$$-pin bowling Maw-Shang designed allows a much larger number of pins that form a larger frame. The following figure shows a standard $$$10$$$-pin frame on the left, and on the right it shows a $$$21$$$-pin frame that forms a triangular shape of side length six which is allowed in the game of $$$X$$$-pin bowling.

Being the national sport, the government of Taiwan strictly regulates and standardizes the manufacturing of bowling pins. There are two types of bowling pins allowed, one in black and the other in white, and the bowling alley Maw-Shang owns has $$$w$$$ white pins and $$$b$$$ black pins. To make this new game exciting for the customers, Maw-Shang wants to build the largest possible frame from these $$$w+b$$$ pins. However, even though he is okay with using both colors in building the frame, for aesthetic reasons, Maw-Shang still wants the colors of the pins on the same row to be identical. For example, the following figure shows two possible frames of side length six, but only the left one is acceptable to Maw-Shang since the other one has white and black pins mixed in the third row.

The monthly special event is happening in just a few hours. Please help Maw-Shang calculate the side length of the largest frame that he can build from his $$$w+b$$$ pins!

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$, the number of test cases. Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains two integers $$$w$$$ and $$$b$$$, the number of white and black pins, respectively.

- $$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$
- $$$0 \leq w, b \leq 10^9$$$

There is, however, a catch: If you make more than three steps in the same direction, you lose balance and fall down. Therefore, it is forbidden to make more than three consecutive steps in the same direction. It is okay to walk three times to the right, then one step to the left, and then again three steps to the right. This has the same effect as taking five steps to the right, but is slower.

When Peter chooses this operation, he always chooses the largest possible value $$$x$$$. Note that the segment occupies the interval $$$[\frac{1}{2}(\ell+x), r]$$$ afterwards.
2. Operation $$$\tt{RTL}$$$: he folds the segment from right to left, where $$$r$$$ coincides with a point $$$x$$$ ($$$\ell \le x < r$$$) such that $$$r+x$$$ is a prime number. When Peter chooses this operation, he always chooses the smallest possible value $$$x$$$. Note that the segment occupies the interval $$$[\ell, \frac{1}{2}(r+x)]$$$ afterwards.

275,"Problem: Claire loves drawing lines. She receives a sheet of paper with an $$$n \times n$$$ grid and begins drawing ""lines"" on it. Well—the concept of a ""line"" here is not what we usually think of. Claire refers each line to be a set of consecutive vertical grid cells. When she draws a line, these cells are all covered with black ink. Initially, all the cells are white, and drawing lines turns some of them black. After drawing a few lines, Claire wonders: how many ways she can color an additional white cell black so that the remaining white cells do not form a single connected component.

Two cells are directly connected if they share an edge. Two cells $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are indirectly connected if there exists a sequence of cells $$$c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_k$$$ with $$$k > 1$$$ such that $$$c_0 = x$$$, $$$c_k = y$$$, and for every $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$$$ the cells $$$c_i$$$ and $$$c_{i-1}$$$ are directly connected. A set of cells forms a single connected component if each pair of cells in the set is either directly or indirectly connected.

The grid has $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns, both indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Claire will draw $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line is drawn in the $$$y_i$$$-th column, from the $$$s_i$$$-th row to the $$$f_i$$$-th row, where $$$s_i \leq f_i$$$ for each $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, q\}$$$. Note that the cells that are passed by at least one of the $$$q$$$ lines are colored black. The following figure shows an example of a $$$20\times 20$$$ grid with $$$q=67$$$ lines. The grid cells marked with red star symbols refer to the cells such that, if Claire colors that cell black, all white cells no longer form a single connected component.

You may assume that, after drawing the $$$q$$$ lines, the remaining white cells form a single connected component with at least three white cells.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains exactly one integer $$$t$$$, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it begins with a line containing exactly two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$. This indicates that the grid is $$$n$$$ by $$$n$$$ and that Claire draws $$$q$$$ lines on it. Then $$$q$$$ lines follow. For each $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, q\}$$$, the $$$i$$$-th line among the $$$q$$$ lines contains exactly three integers $$$y_i$$$, $$$s_i$$$, and $$$f_i$$$.

Alice likes singing. As a singing enthusiast, Alice has listened to countless songs and has tried singing them many times. However, occasionally, some songs make Alice feel bored. After some research, Alice believes that this is because even though the songs she chose are all different, due to her instinctive preference, they all turn out to be musically similar to one another.

To thoroughly analyze this, Alice decided to study the sheet music of the songs. For convenience, Alice represented a song of length $$$n$$$ as an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the pitch of the $$$i$$$-th note. Then she defined the musical equivalence between songs. Two songs $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ are musically equivalent if for all $$$1\leq i<n$$$, both $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ and $$$b_{i}, b_{i+1}$$$ have the same pitch relationship. More specifically, $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ and $$$b_i, b_{i+1}$$$ have the same pitch relationship if either

- $$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i < b_{i + 1}$$$,
- $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i = b_{i + 1}$$$, or

277,"Problem: You are designing a snazzy new text editor, and you want to add a nifty auto-complete feature to help users save time. Here is how it will work: if a user types ""App"", your editor will magically suggest the word ""Application""! Even better, users can personalize the words that auto-complete in your editor.

Your editor will support 4 kinds of operations (Let's say the current text in your editor is $$$t$$$):

1. Add an auto complete pattern $$$p_i$$$.
2. Delete an auto complete pattern $$$p_i$$$.
3. Append a string $$$s$$$ to the end of $$$t$$$.
4. Delete $$$c$$$ characters from the end of $$$t$$$. Note that if $$$c$$$ is larger then the length of $$$t$$$, delete all the characters from $$$t$$$.

After each action, your editor should suggest an auto-complete candidate $$$i$$$ that matches the following criteria:

1. The string $$$p_i$$$ has a prefix equal to $$$t$$$.
2. If there are multiple $$$p_i$$$, pick the longest one.
3. If there are still multiple $$$p_i$$$, pick the one with the smallest lexicographic order.
4. If there are still multiple $$$p_i$$$, pick the one with the smallest ID.

For example, let us say we have three candidates: ""alice"", ""bob"", and ""charlie"", with ID 1, 2, and 3. At first, there is nothing on the screen, so ""charlie"" (3) should be suggested because it is the longest. Then, let us say the user types ""b"". You should suggest ""bob"" (2) because it is the only one that starts with ""b"". Finally, let us say the user type ""body"". You should print -1 because there is no matched pattern.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$, followed by $$$n$$$ lines, with each line containing an action.

There are four types of actions:

1. $$$i$$$ $$$p_i$$$
2. $$$i$$$
3. $$$s$$$
4. $$$c$$$

- $$$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$
- The total number of characters in all $$$p_i$$$ and $$$s$$$ does not exceed $$$2\times 10^6$$$.
- $$$1 \leq c \leq 2\times 10^6$$$
- The strings $$$p_i$$$ and $$$s$$$ may contain any printable characters, excluding all space characters (ASCII number in the range from $$$33$$$ to $$$126$$$).
- The ID $$$i$$$ for each add operation is unique.
- The ID $$$i$$$ for each delete is guaranteed to be valid.
- Each ID $$$i$$$ satisfies $$$0\le i \le n$$$.

The program should output $$$n$$$ lines. For each action, output an integer $$$i$$$, which means that after the action, $$$p_i$$$ is the suggested auto complete candidate. If there is no $$$p_i$$$ that matches the requirement, output -1.

Mayaw works in a renowned Epah (aboriginal Taiwanese millet wine; Epah is the Pangcah term for aboriginal Taiwanese millet wine, named in the language of the Pangcah people, the largest Indigenous group in Taiwan) bar in the Fata'an Village. To showcase the depth of its collections, the bar has a two-row wine rack where each row can fit exactly $$$n$$$ bottles. There are already $$$n$$$ bottles placed on the back row of the rack, where the $$$i$$$-th bottle from left has height $$$a_i$$$. The owner of the bar has another $$$n$$$ bottles with distinct heights $$$b_1, \ldots, b_n$$$ that he would like Mayaw to put on the first row. To ensure that all bottles on the rack are visible, the owner requires that each bottle on the back row should not be blocked by the one put in front of it. That is, if a bottle of height $$$h$$$ is put on the $$$i$$$-th spot (from left) in the first row, then $$$h$$$ must be less than $$$a_i$$$. However, not all such arrangements are good for the owner. To pay tributes to the Maxi Mountain nearby, he additionally demands that the bottles in the front row should display a mountain-like shape. In particular, the heights of the bottles, when listing from left to right, should form a sequence that is first (non-strictly) increasing and then (non-strictly) decreasing.

Unfortunately, sometimes it is impossible to achieve owner's requirements. That is why Mayaw is also allowed to slightly reduce a bottle's height by removing its cap that has a height of $$$1$$$. In other words, after the removal of the cap, the height of the bottle decreases by exactly $$$1$$$. Of course, exposing the Epah inside the bottle to the open air is detrimental to its quality, and therefore it is desirable to remove as few bottle caps as possible.

Can you help Mayaw determine the minimum number of caps needed to be removed so that he can arrange the bottles in a way that satisfies the owner's requirements? Note that the positions of the bottles in the back row are fixed and Mayaw is not allowed to modify them.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ which represents the number of bottles in each row. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$, the height of the bottles in the back row. The third line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$b_1, \ldots, b_n$$$, the height of the bottles in the front row.

- $$$1 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^5$$$
- $$$1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9$$$
- All $$$b_i$$$'s are distinct.

Output the minimum number of bottle caps needed to be removed so that Mayaw can arrange the bottles in the desired way. If it is impossible to achieve that (regardless of the number of caps removed), output -1 instead.

279,"Problem: Image generated by ChatGPT 4o.

In an interdisciplinary collaboration, an ecosystem scientist and a computer scientist join forces to analyze the structure of a complex ecosystem using computational methods. The ecosystem scientist models the ecosystem as a directed graph $$$D = (V, A)$$$, where each species is represented by a node $$$v \in V$$$, and each feeding relationship is represented as a directed edge $$$(x, y) \in A$$$ from prey $$$x$$$ to predator $$$y$$$. This graph structure allows them to simulate the flow of energy throughout the ecosystem from one species to another.

Two essential features of the ecosystem are defined:

- Independent Trophic Group: A set $$$S$$$ of animal species is classified as an independent trophic group if no species $$$x \in S$$$ can reach another species $$$y \in S$$$ (for some $$$y \ne x$$$) through a series of directed feeding relationships, meaning there is no directed path in $$$D$$$ from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$.
- Trophic Balance Species: A species is termed a trophic balance species if it has a nearly equal number of species that affect it as directly or indirectly predators (species it can reach via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself) and species that affect it as directly or indirectly prey (species that can reach it via a directed path in $$$D$$$, excluding itself). Specifically, trophic balance species are those for which the absolute difference between the above two numbers is minimum among all species in the ecosystem.

Consider an ecosystem with $$$n = 4$$$ species and $$$m = 3$$$ feeding relationships:

- Species 1: Grass (Node 1)
- Species 2: Rabbits (Node 2)
- Species 3: Foxes (Node 3)
- Species 4: Hawks (Node 4)

The directed edges representing the feeding relationships are as follows:

- $$$(1, 2)$$$: Grass is eaten by Rabbits.
- $$$(2, 3)$$$: Rabbits are eaten by Foxes.
- $$$(2, 4)$$$: Rabbits are also eaten by Hawks.

Now, consider the set $$$S=\{3,4\}$$$ (Foxes and Hawks). There are no directed paths between Foxes (Node 3) and Hawks (Node 4); Foxes cannot reach Hawks, and Hawks cannot reach Foxes through any directed paths. Therefore, this set qualifies as an independent trophic group.

Examination of Species

- Species 1 (Grass):    Can reach: 3 (Rabbits, Foxes, and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 0 (None)    Absolute difference: $$$|3 - 0| = 3$$$
- Species 2 (Rabbits):   Can reach: 2 (Foxes and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 1 (Grass)    Absolute difference: $$$|2 - 1| = 1$$$
- Species 3 (Foxes):   Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: $$$|0-2| = 2$$$
- Species 4 (Hawks):   Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: $$$|0-2| = 2$$$

Among these species, Rabbits have the smallest absolute difference of $$$1$$$, indicating that they are a trophic balance species within the ecosystem.

It is known that any independent trophic group in the ecosystem has a size of at most $$$k$$$. The task is to find the set of all trophic balance species in the ecosystem.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains exactly two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, where $$$n$$$ (resp. $$$m$$$) denotes the number of nodes (resp. edges) in the directed graph $$$D$$$ induced by the investigated ecosystem. The nodes are numbered as $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$. Then, $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ indicating a directed edge from node $$$x_i$$$ to node $$$y_i$$$.

- $$$1 \le n \le 2 \times 10^5$$$
- $$$0 \le m \le \min\{ n(n-1), 4 \times 10^5\}$$$
- $$$k$$$ is not an input value, and it is guaranteed that $$$1 \le k \le 16$$$ for each investigated ecosystem.
- For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le m$$$), $$$1\le x_i, y_i\le n$$$ and $$$x_i\neq y_i$$$.
- Each ordered pair $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ appears at most once in the input.

Output on a single line the node identidiers of all trophic balance species in ascending order. For any two consecutive node identifiers, separate them by a space.

280,"Problem: A-Ju has a gorgeous castle in which she often enjoys living. However, she gets tired of living in the castle for a long time. Thus, she decides to rebuild her castle into some specific shape to make her it more beautiful.

Let's say we represent A-Ju's castle as a 2D convex polygon$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ on the 2D plane. A-Ju aims to rebuild her castle into a point symmetric convex polygon. Here, a polygon is point symmetric if there exists a center $$$c$$$ such that for every point $$$p$$$ in the polygon, the reflection $$$p^\prime$$$ of $$$p$$$ across $$$c$$$ is also in the polygon.

While designing an arbitrary point symmetric convex polygon shape is easy, the cost of rebuilding is very high. After some estimation, A-Ju found that the cost of rebuilding is proportional to the area of the symmetric difference$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ between the original castle and the new castle. See the following figure for an example:

In the example above, A-Ju's castle is a shape of the convex polygon formed by points $$$(3, 7) - (2, 1) - (6, 3)$$$. After rebuilding her castle into the shape of the polygon formed by $$$(3, 7) - (\frac{7}{3}, 3) - (\frac{13}{3}, \frac{1}{3}) - (5, \frac{13}{3})$$$, the area of the symmetric difference between these two polygons will be $$$\frac{11}{3}$$$. The difference can be calculated as the sum of the additional area (represented by the green grid region) and the shaved area (represented by the red line region).

Please write a program that helps A-Ju design a blueprint of the new castle, such that the area of the symmetric difference between the original one and the new one is minimized. You only need to output the minimum value since A-Ju wants to estimate her cost first.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$, representing the number of vertices of the polygon that forms A-Ju's castle.

Then, $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains two integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$, representing the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th vertex. The vertices are given in a counterclockwise order.

- $$$3\leq n\leq 500$$$
- $$$|x_i|, |y_i|\leq 10^4$$$
- The vertices are given in a counterclockwise order and are guaranteed to form a convex polygon without three collinear points.

Print a single real number in one line, representing the minimum area of the symmetric difference between the original castle and the new castle.

Your answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-4}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is considered correct if $$$\frac{|a-b|}{\max(1,|b|)}\le 10^{-4}$$$.

281,"Problem: Every student enrolled in the algorithms course is required to submit an assignment this week. The task is to implement an $$$O(n^2)$$$-time algorithm to sort $$$n$$$ given integers in non-decreasing order. Alice has already completed her assignment, and her implementation is shown below.

While you have access to Alice's code, you prefer not to simply copy it. Instead, you want to use Alice's sorting function as a building block for your own solution. There are two ways as listed below you can utilize her function, but each of them can be applied at most once. The order in which these two operations are invoked can be arbitrary.

- Prefix sort: choose a length $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$$$ and call $$$\texttt{alicesort(}s, i\texttt{)}$$$. This sorts the first $$$i$$$ elements in the array $$$s$$$.
- Suffix sort: choose a length $$$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$$$ and call $$$\texttt{alicesort(}s+n-i, i\texttt{)}$$$. This sorts the last $$$i$$$ elements in the array $$$s$$$.

Due to the time complexity of the sorting algorithm, the cost of performing either a prefix or suffix sort is $$$i^2$$$, where $$$i$$$ is the length of the chosen subarray. Your goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort the input array $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers in non-decreasing order using Alice's function, following the rules mentioned above.

For example, Let $$$s=[3,2,5,5,4,1]$$$. We can first perform a suffix sort of length $$$4$$$, and the array becomes $$$[3,2,1,4,5,5]$$$. Then, we perform a prefix sort of length $$$3$$$, and the array becomes $$$[1,2,3,4,5,5]$$$, which is a sorted array. The cost is $$$4^2+3^2=25$$$. Here is another example, let $$$s=[4,3,2,1]$$$. We can complete the sorting by performing only a prefix sort of length $$$4$$$, and the cost is $$$4^2=16$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains exactly one integer $$$n$$$ which indicates the number of integers in the array $$$s$$$. The second line contains the $$$n$$$ integers in $$$s=[s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_{n-1}]$$$.

282,"Problem: The country of Truckski is located in a rugged, mountainous region, and the geological condition has engendered a wide range of issues. The challenging terrain separates the different states in the country, resulting in an extremely inconvenient inter-state commute and more crucially a lack of central governmental control. Adding on top of that is a rampant crime rate that increases annually, and this severely disrupts the everyday lives of innocent citizens.

A recent protest finally shed light on the situation, as the newly elected president has announced an ambitious project to resolve these issues. Her plan consists of two major components. The first is the construction of high-speed railways between the states to facilitate better connections and unity across the country. Since the states are mostly running independently from each other, to construct a railway between states $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, the government has to pay a fee of $$$a_u + a_v$$$ dollars, with $$$a_u$$$ dollars given to state $$$u$$$ and $$$a_v$$$ dollars given to state $$$v$$$. The railway operates bidirectionally, meaning that once it is built, people from state $$$u$$$ can now travel to state $$$v$$$ and vice versa. A railway can be built between almost any pair of states, except for $$$m$$$ particular pairs for which the terrain dividing them is so treacherous that the construction of a direct railroad between the two states becomes impossible.

The second component of the project is to build a centralized prison that manages all criminals across the country. Given the large number of estimated prisoners, the president decided to pick one of the states to build the central prison and sever the connection from the state to the rest of the country.

An illustration for the sample input 1. (a) The costs of building direct railways between the states. (b) Consider building the central prison in State #3. All direct railroads that do not involve State #3 have to be built, with a total cost of $$$3+3+2=8$$$ dollars.

Given the above, the president would like to search for the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between the states so that:

- the state with the central prison should not have any railway connecting it to any other states, and
- all the other states should be connected, i.e., people should be able to travel from one such state to another, possibly by taking more than one train.

You are working for the team in charge of the overall planning of the construction. The meeting with the president is happening in just a few hours, at which time you will have to brief her on the cost of different construction plans. Please calculate, for each state $$$u$$$, the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between states meeting the above conditions when $$$u$$$ is where the central prison is built.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, the number of states in Truckski and the number of pairs for which railroad construction is not feasible. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$, the construction fee the government needs to pay to the $$$i$$$-th state. Then, $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ meaning that it is impossible to build a (direct) railway between states $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.

- $$$2\leq n\leq 10^5$$$
- $$$0\leq m\leq 10^5$$$
- $$$1\leq a_i\leq 10^9$$$
- $$$1\leq u_i<v_i\leq n$$$
- For all $$$i\neq j, (u_i, v_i)\neq (u_j, v_j)$$$.

Output $$$n$$$ integers in one line. The $$$i$$$-th integer is the minimum construction cost when the $$$i$$$-th state is where the prison is built. If it is impossible to find a feasible railroad construction, output -1 instead.

- If he skipped the $$$i$$$-th problem, it looks at problems with indices $$$j \leq b_i$$$.

Among these problems, it selects the problem with the maximum index that it has not previously given to the participant (he has neither submitted nor skipped it before).

Each of the $$$2n$$$ vertices belongs to exactly one of two types: incoming or outgoing. For each vertex, its type is known to you.

You need to determine whether it is possible to draw exactly $$$n$$$ directed edges between the source graphs such that the following four conditions are met:

- The ends of any added edge lie in different graphs.
- From each outgoing vertex, exactly one added edge originates.
- Into each incoming vertex, exactly one added edge enters.
- In the resulting graph, the length of any cycle is divisible by $$$k$$$.

286,"Problem: Recently, you received a rare ticket to the only casino in the world where you can actually earn something, and you want to take full advantage of this opportunity.

The conditions in this casino are as follows:

- There are a total of $$$n$$$ games in the casino.
- You can play each game at most once.
- Each game is characterized by two parameters: $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le 100$$$) and $$$w_i$$$ — the probability of winning the game in percentage and the winnings for a win.
- If you lose in any game you decide to play, you will receive nothing at all (even for the games you won).

You need to choose a set of games in advance that you will play in such a way as to maximize the expected value of your winnings.

In this case, if you choose to play the games with indices $$$i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k$$$, you will win in all of them with a probability of $$$\prod\limits_{j=1}^k \frac{p_{i_j}}{100}$$$, and in that case, your winnings will be equal to $$$\sum\limits_{j=1}^k w_{i_j}$$$.

That is, the expected value of your winnings will be $$$\left(\prod\limits_{j=1}^k \frac{p_{i_j}}{100}\right) \cdot \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^k w_{i_j}\right)$$$.

To avoid going bankrupt, the casino owners have limited the expected value of winnings for each individual game. Thus, for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$), it holds that $$$w_i \cdot p_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Your task is to find the maximum expected value of winnings that can be obtained by choosing some set of games in the casino.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of games offered to play.

The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$p_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq 100$$$, $$$1 \leq w_i, p_i \cdot w_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the probability of winning and the size of the winnings in the $$$i$$$-th game.

Output a single number — the maximum expected value of winnings in the casino that can be obtained by choosing some subset of games.

Your answer will be accepted if the relative or absolute error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$. Formally, if $$$a$$$ is your answer and $$$b$$$ is the jury's answer, it will be accepted if $$$\frac{|a-b|}{\max(b, 1)} \le 10^{-6}$$$.

287,"Problem: In the heart of an ancient kingdom grows the legendary Tree of Life — the only one of its kind and the source of magical power for the entire world. The tree consists of $$$n$$$ nodes. Each node of this tree is a magical source, connected to other such sources through magical channels (edges). In total, there are $$$n-1$$$ channels in the tree, with the $$$i$$$-th channel connecting nodes $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$. Moreover, there exists a unique simple path through the channels between any two nodes in the tree.

However, the magical energy flowing through these channels must be balanced; otherwise, the power of the Tree of Life may disrupt the natural order and cause catastrophic consequences. The sages of the kingdom discovered that when two magical channels converge at a single node, a dangerous ""magical resonance vibration"" occurs between them. To protect the Tree of Life and maintain its balance, it is necessary to select several paths and perform special rituals along them. A path is a sequence of distinct nodes $$$v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$$$, where each pair of adjacent nodes $$$v_i$$$ and $$$v_{i+1}$$$ is connected by a channel. When the sages perform a ritual along such a path, the resonance vibration between the channels $$$(v_i, v_{i+1})$$$ and $$$(v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$$$ is blocked for each $$$1 \leq i \leq k - 2$$$.

The sages' task is to select the minimum number of paths and perform rituals along them to block all resonance vibrations. This means that for every pair of channels emanating from a single node, there must exist at least one selected path that contains both of these channels.

Help the sages find the minimum number of such paths so that the magical balance of the Tree of Life is preserved, and its power continues to nourish the entire world!

288,"Problem: In a desert city with a hilly landscape, the city hall decided to level the road surface by purchasing a dump truck. The road is divided into $$$n$$$ sections, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. The height of the surface in the $$$i$$$-th section is equal to $$$a_i$$$. If the height of the $$$i$$$-th section is greater than $$$0$$$, then the dump truck must take sand from the $$$i$$$-th section of the road, and if the height of the $$$i$$$-th section is less than $$$0$$$, the dump truck must fill the pit in the $$$i$$$-th section of the road with sand. It is guaranteed that the initial heights are not equal to $$$0$$$.

When the dump truck is in the $$$i$$$-th section of the road, it can either take away $$$x$$$ units of sand, in which case the height of the surface in the $$$i$$$-th section will decrease by $$$x$$$, or it can fill in $$$x$$$ units of sand (provided that it currently has at least $$$x$$$ units of sand in its bed), in which case the height of the surface in the $$$i$$$-th section of the road will increase by $$$x$$$.

The dump truck can start its journey from any section of the road. Moving to an adjacent section on the left or right takes $$$1$$$ minute, and the time for loading and unloading sand can be neglected. The dump truck has an infinite capacity and is initially empty.

You need to find the minimum time required for the dump truck to level the sand so that the height in each section becomes equal to $$$0$$$. Note that after all movements, the dump truck may still have sand left in its bed. You need to solve this problem independently for the segments numbered from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$. Sand outside the segment cannot be used.

He decides to determine a turn order, determined by a permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, such that the $$$p_i$$$'th cow will be the $$$i$$$'th cow to place a card on top of the center pile in a round.

In other words, the following events happen in order in each round:

- If $$$s_i$$$ is p, then $$$[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i]$$$ forms a permutation (of length $$$i$$$);
- If $$$s_i$$$ is s, then $$$[p_i, p_{i+1}, \ldots, p_{n}]$$$ forms a permutation (of length $$$n-i+1$$$);
- If $$$s_i$$$ is ., then there is no additional restriction.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 500$$$), the length of $$$s$$$.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that consists of the characters p, s, and ..

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.

For each test case, output YES or NO on a line. Output YES if there is such a permutation and NO otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings ""yEs"", ""yes"", ""Yes"", and ""YES"" will be recognized as positive responses.

Let $$$(i, j)$$$ denote the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row from the top and $$$j$$$-th column from the left ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le j \le m$$$). For every cell $$$(i, j)$$$, the integer $$$a_{i, j}$$$ is written on the cell $$$(i, j)$$$.

You are initially at $$$(1, 1)$$$ and want to go to $$$(n, m)$$$. You may only move down or right. That is, if you are at $$$(i, j)$$$, you can only move to $$$(i+1, j)$$$ or $$$(i, j+1)$$$ (if the corresponding cell exists).

Before you begin moving, you may do the following operation any number of times:

- Choose an integer $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ and cyclically shift row $$$i$$$ to the left by $$$1$$$. Formally, simultaneously set $$$a_{i,j}$$$ to $$$a_{i,(j \bmod m) + 1}$$$ for all integers $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le m$$$).

You have a magical device that takes ranges and returns range sums, but it returns the opposite result when the range has length at least $$$k$$$. Formally, in one query, you can give it a pair of integers $$$[l, r]$$$ where $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$, and it will return either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ according to the following rules:

- If $$$r - l + 1 < k$$$, it will return $$$s(l, r)$$$.
- If $$$r - l + 1 \ge k$$$, it will return $$$1 - s(l, r)$$$.

Sorting through some notes that were left behind, you found a curious statement named Problem 101:

- Given a positive integer sequence $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$, you can operate on it any number of times. In an operation, you choose three consecutive elements $$$a_i,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}$$$, and merge them into one element $$$\max(a_i+1,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}+1)$$$. Please calculate the maximum number of operations you can do without creating an element greater than $$$m$$$.

After some thought, you decided to propose the following problem, named Counting 101:

352,"Problem: Roaming through the alligator-infested Everglades, Florida Man encounters a most peculiar showdown.

There are $$$n$$$ lilypads arranged in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Alice and Bob are frogs initially positioned on distinct lilypads, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, respectively. They take turns jumping, starting with Alice.

During a frog's turn, it can jump either one space to the left or one space to the right, as long as the destination lilypad exists. For example, on Alice's first turn, she can jump to either lilypad $$$a-1$$$ or $$$a+1$$$, provided these lilypads are within bounds. It is important to note that each frog must jump during its turn and cannot remain on the same lilypad.

However, there are some restrictions:

- The two frogs cannot occupy the same lilypad. This means that Alice cannot jump to a lilypad that Bob is currently occupying, and vice versa.
- If a frog cannot make a valid jump on its turn, it loses the game. As a result, the other frog wins.

Determine whether Alice can guarantee a win, assuming that both players play optimally. It can be proven that the game will end after a finite number of moves if both players play optimally.

354,"Problem: There are no mountains in Florida, and Florida Man cannot comprehend their existence. As such, he really needs your help with this one.

In the wilderness lies a region of mountainous terrain represented as a rectangular grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Each cell in the grid is identified by its position $$$(i, j)$$$, where $$$i$$$ is the row index and $$$j$$$ is the column index. The altitude of cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is denoted by $$$a_{i,j}$$$.

However, this region has been tampered with. A path consisting of $$$n + m - 1$$$ cells, starting from the top-left corner $$$(1, 1)$$$ and ending at the bottom-right corner $$$(n, m)$$$, has been cleared. For every cell $$$(i, j)$$$ along this path, the altitude $$$a_{i,j}$$$ has been set to $$$0$$$. The path moves strictly via downward ($$$\mathtt{D}$$$) or rightward ($$$\mathtt{R}$$$) steps.

To restore the terrain to its original state, it is known that the region possessed a magical property before it was tampered with: all rows and all columns shared the same sum of altitudes. More formally, there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$\sum_{j=1}^m a_{i, j} = x$$$ for all $$$1\le i\le n$$$, and $$$\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i, j} = x$$$ for all $$$1\le j\le m$$$.

Your task is to assign new altitudes to the cells on the path such that the above magical property is restored. It can be proven that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions that satisfy the property, any one of them may be provided.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n+m-2$$$ ($$$s_i = \mathtt{D}$$$ or $$$s_i = \mathtt{R}$$$) — the steps the path makes from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, m)$$$. The character $$$\mathtt{D}$$$ represents a downward step, and $$$\mathtt{R}$$$ represents a rightward step.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines each contain $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i, 2}, \ldots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$-10^6 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^6$$$) — the altitude of each cell in the grid. It is guaranteed that if a cell $$$(i, j)$$$ lies on the path, then $$$a_{i,j} = 0$$$.

355,"Problem: At his orange orchard, Florida Man receives yet another spam letter, delivered by a crow. Naturally, he's sending it back in the most inconvenient manner possible.

A crow is sitting at position $$$0$$$ of the number line. There are $$$n$$$ scarecrows positioned at integer coordinates $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ along the number line. These scarecrows have been enchanted, allowing them to move left and right at a speed of $$$1$$$ unit per second.

The crow is afraid of scarecrows and wants to stay at least a distance of $$$k$$$ ahead of the nearest scarecrow positioned at or before it. To do so, the crow uses its teleportation ability as follows:

- Let $$$x$$$ be the current position of the crow, and let $$$y$$$ be the largest position of a scarecrow such that $$$y \le x$$$. If $$$x - y < k$$$, meaning the scarecrow is too close, the crow will instantly teleport to position $$$y + k$$$.

This teleportation happens instantly and continuously. The crow will keep checking for scarecrows positioned at or to the left of him and teleport whenever one gets too close (which could happen at non-integral times). Note that besides this teleportation ability, the crow will not move on its own.

Your task is to determine the minimum time required to make the crow teleport to a position greater than or equal to $$$\ell$$$, assuming the scarecrows move optimally to allow the crow to reach its goal. For convenience, you are asked to output twice the minimum time needed for the crow to reach the target position $$$\ell$$$. It can be proven that this value will always be an integer.

Note that the scarecrows can start, stop, or change direction at any time (possibly at non-integral times).

358,"Problem: Iris has a tree rooted at vertex $$$1$$$. Each vertex has a value of $$$\mathtt 0$$$ or $$$\mathtt 1$$$.

Let's consider a leaf of the tree (the vertex $$$1$$$ is never considered a leaf) and define its weight. Construct a string formed by the values of the vertices on the path starting at the root and ending in this leaf. Then the weight of the leaf is the difference between the number of occurrences of $$$\mathtt{10}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{01}$$$ substrings in it.

Take the following tree as an example. Green vertices have a value of $$$\mathtt 1$$$ while white vertices have a value of $$$\mathtt 0$$$.

- Let's calculate the weight of the leaf $$$5$$$: the formed string is $$$\mathtt{10110}$$$. The number of occurrences of substring $$$\mathtt{10}$$$ is $$$2$$$, the number of occurrences of substring $$$\mathtt{01}$$$ is $$$1$$$, so the difference is $$$2 - 1 = 1$$$.
- Let's calculate the weight of the leaf $$$6$$$: the formed string is $$$\mathtt{101}$$$. The number of occurrences of substring $$$\mathtt{10}$$$ is $$$1$$$, the number of occurrences of substring $$$\mathtt{01}$$$ is $$$1$$$, so the difference is $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$.

The score of a tree is defined as the number of leaves with non-zero weight in the tree.

But the values of some vertices haven't been decided and will be given to you as $$$\texttt{?}$$$. Filling the blanks would be so boring, so Iris is going to invite Dora to play a game. On each turn, one of the girls chooses any of the remaining vertices with value $$$\texttt{?}$$$ and changes its value to $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$\mathtt{1}$$$, with Iris going first. The game continues until there are no vertices with value $$$\mathtt{?}$$$ left in the tree. Iris aims to maximize the score of the tree, while Dora aims to minimize that.

359,"Problem: Given a rooted tree with the root at vertex $$$1$$$. For any vertex $$$i$$$ ($$$1 < i \leq n$$$) in the tree, there is an edge connecting vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i < i$$$), with a weight equal to $$$t_i$$$.

Iris does not know the values of $$$t_i$$$, but she knows that $$$\displaystyle\sum_{i=2}^n t_i = w$$$ and each of the $$$t_i$$$ is a non-negative integer.

The vertices of the tree are numbered in a special way: the numbers of the vertices in each subtree are consecutive integers. In other words, the vertices of the tree are numbered in the order of a depth-first search.

The tree in this picture satisfies the condition. For example, in the subtree of vertex $$$2$$$, the vertex numbers are $$$2, 3, 4, 5$$$, which are consecutive integers.

The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, as in the subtree of vertex $$$2$$$, the vertex numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ are not consecutive integers.

We define $$$\operatorname{dist}(u, v)$$$ as the length of the simple path between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the tree.

Next, there will be $$$n - 1$$$ events:

- Iris is given integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, indicating that $$$t_x = y$$$.

After each event, Iris wants to know the maximum possible value of $$$\operatorname{dist}(i, i \bmod n + 1)$$$ independently for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$). She only needs to know the sum of these $$$n$$$ values. Please help Iris quickly get the answers.

Note that when calculating the maximum possible values of $$$\operatorname{dist}(i, i \bmod n + 1)$$$ and $$$\operatorname{dist}(j, j \bmod n + 1)$$$ for $$$i \ne j$$$, the unknown edge weights may be different.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq w \leq 10^{12}$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the sum of the edge weights.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i < i$$$) — the description of the edges of the tree.

Then follow $$$n-1$$$ lines indicating the events. Each line contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$2 \leq x \leq n$$$, $$$0 \leq y \leq w$$$), indicating that $$$t_x = y$$$.

It is guaranteed that all $$$x$$$ in the events are distinct. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all $$$y$$$ equals $$$w$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

360,"Problem: Let there be a set that contains distinct positive integers. To expand the set to contain as many integers as possible, Eri can choose two integers $$$x\neq y$$$ from the set such that their average $$$\frac{x+y}2$$$ is still a positive integer and isn't contained in the set, and add it to the set. The integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ remain in the set.

Let's call the set of integers consecutive if, after the elements are sorted, the difference between any pair of adjacent elements is $$$1$$$. For example, sets $$$\{2\}$$$, $$$\{2, 5, 4, 3\}$$$, $$$\{5, 6, 8, 7\}$$$ are consecutive, while $$$\{2, 4, 5, 6\}$$$, $$$\{9, 7\}$$$ are not.

Eri likes consecutive sets. Suppose there is an array $$$b$$$, then Eri puts all elements in $$$b$$$ into the set. If after a finite number of operations described above, the set can become consecutive, the array $$$b$$$ will be called brilliant.

Note that if the same integer appears in the array multiple times, we only put it into the set once, as a set always contains distinct positive integers.

Eri has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. Please help him to count the number of pairs of integers $$$(l,r)$$$ such that $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$ and the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$ is brilliant.

Now she is given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ elements, and she needs to calculate the product of each two adjacent elements (that is, $$$a_1 \cdot a_2$$$, $$$a_2 \cdot a_3$$$, and so on). Iris wants her brain to work safely, and in order to do that, she would like to modify the array $$$a$$$ in such a way that $$$a_i \cdot a_{i + 1} \leq k$$$ holds for every $$$1 \leq i < n$$$.

1. She can rearrange the elements of the array $$$a$$$ in an arbitrary way.
2. She can select an arbitrary element of the array $$$a$$$ and change its value to an arbitrary integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$.

Iris wants to minimize the number of operations of type $$$2$$$ that she uses.

362,"Problem: Iris likes full binary trees.

Let's define the depth of a rooted tree as the maximum number of vertices on the simple paths from some vertex to the root. A full binary tree of depth $$$d$$$ is a binary tree of depth $$$d$$$ with exactly $$$2^d - 1$$$ vertices.

Iris calls a tree a $$$d$$$-binary tree if some vertices and edges can be added to it to make it a full binary tree of depth $$$d$$$. Note that any vertex can be chosen as the root of a full binary tree.

Since performing operations on large trees is difficult, she defines the binary depth of a tree as the minimum $$$d$$$ satisfying that the tree is $$$d$$$-binary. Specifically, if there is no integer $$$d \ge 1$$$ such that the tree is $$$d$$$-binary, the binary depth of the tree is $$$-1$$$.

Iris now has a tree consisting of only vertex $$$1$$$. She wants to add $$$n - 1$$$ more vertices to form a larger tree. She will add the vertices one by one.

363,"Problem: Sadly, Dora poured the paint when painting the class mural. Dora considers the mural as the matrix $$$b$$$ of size $$$n \times n$$$. Initially, $$$b_{i,j} = 0$$$ for all $$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$.

Dora has only two brushes which have two different colors. In one operation, she can paint the matrix with one of two brushes:

- The first brush has color $$$1$$$ on it and can paint one column of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $$$1 \leq j \leq n$$$ and makes $$$b_{i,j} := 1$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$;
- The second brush has color $$$2$$$ on it and can paint one row of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ and makes $$$b_{i,j} := 2$$$ for all $$$1 \leq j \leq n$$$.

Dora paints the matrix so that the resulting matrix $$$b$$$ contains only $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$.

For a matrix $$$b$$$, let $$$f(b)$$$ denote the minimum number of operations needed to turn the initial matrix (containing only $$$0$$$) into $$$b$$$. The beauty of a matrix $$$b$$$ is the number of ways to paint the initial matrix in exactly $$$f(b)$$$ operations to turn it into $$$b$$$. If there's no way to turn the initial matrix into $$$b$$$, the beauty of $$$b$$$ is $$$0$$$.

369,"Problem: You have obtained the new limited event character Xilonen. You decide to use her in combat.

There are $$$n$$$ enemies in a line. The $$$i$$$'th enemy from the left has health $$$h_i$$$ and is currently at position $$$x_i$$$. Xilonen has an attack damage of $$$m$$$, and you are ready to defeat the enemies with her.

Xilonen has a powerful ""ground stomp"" attack. Before you perform any attacks, you select an integer $$$p$$$ and position Xilonen there ($$$p$$$ can be any integer position, including a position with an enemy currently). Afterwards, for each attack, she deals $$$m$$$ damage to an enemy at position $$$p$$$ (if there are any), $$$m-1$$$ damage to enemies at positions $$$p-1$$$ and $$$p+1$$$, $$$m-2$$$ damage to enemies at positions $$$p-2$$$ and $$$p+2$$$, and so on. Enemies that are at least a distance of $$$m$$$ away from Xilonen take no damage from attacks.

Formally, if there is an enemy at position $$$x$$$, she will deal $$$\max(0,m - |p - x|)$$$ damage to that enemy each hit. Note that you may not choose a different $$$p$$$ for different attacks.

Over all possible $$$p$$$, output the minimum number of attacks Xilonen must perform to defeat at least $$$k$$$ enemies. If it is impossible to find a $$$p$$$ such that eventually at least $$$k$$$ enemies will be defeated, output $$$-1$$$ instead.

381,"Problem: Kevin and Nivek are competing for the title of ""The Best Kevin"". They aim to determine the winner through $$$n$$$ matches.

The $$$i$$$-th match can be one of two types:

- Type 1: Kevin needs to spend $$$a_i$$$ time to defeat Nivek and win the match. If Kevin doesn't spend $$$a_i$$$ time on it, Nivek will win the match.
- Type 2: The outcome of this match depends on their historical records. If Kevin's number of wins is greater than or equal to Nivek's up to this match, then Kevin wins. Otherwise, Nivek wins.

Kevin wants to know the minimum amount of time he needs to spend to ensure he wins at least $$$k$$$ matches.

Output the answers for $$$k = 0, 1, \ldots, n$$$.

The monster's nerve system can be structured as a tree$$$^{\dagger}$$$ of $$$n$$$ nodes (really, everything should stop resembling trees all the time$$$\ldots$$$), numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$, with node $$$0$$$ as the root.

Gretel's objective is to learn the exact structure of the monster's nerve system — more specifically, she wants to know the values $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{n-1}$$$ of the tree, where $$$p_i$$$ ($$$0 \le p_i < i$$$) is the direct parent node of node $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n - 1$$$).

She doesn't know exactly how the nodes are placed, but she knows a few convenient facts:

- If we remove root node $$$0$$$ and all adjacent edges, this tree will turn into a forest consisting of only paths$$$^{\ddagger}$$$. Each node that was initially adjacent to the node $$$0$$$ will be the end of some path.
- The nodes are indexed in a way that if $$$1 \le x \le y \le n - 1$$$, then $$$p_x \le p_y$$$.
- Node $$$1$$$ has exactly two adjacent nodes (including the node $$$0$$$).

The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because if we remove node $$$0$$$, then node $$$2$$$ (which was initially adjacent to the node $$$0$$$) will not be the end of the path $$$4-2-5$$$.The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because $$$p_3 \le p_4$$$ must hold.The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because node $$$1$$$ has only one adjacent node.

Gretel can make queries to the containment cell:

- ""? a b"" ($$$1 \le a, b < n$$$, $$$a \ne b$$$) — the cell will check if the simple path between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ contains the node $$$0$$$.

However, to avoid unexpected consequences by overstimulating the creature, Gretel wants to query at most $$$2n - 6$$$ times. Though Gretel is gifted, she can't do everything all at once, so can you give her a helping hand?

394,"Problem: Having the magical beanstalk, Jack has been gathering a lot of peanuts lately. Eventually, he has obtained $$$n$$$ pockets of peanuts, conveniently numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. The $$$i$$$-th pocket has $$$a_i$$$ peanuts.

Jack and his childhood friend Alice decide to play a game around the peanuts. First, Alice divides the pockets into some boxes; each box will have a non-zero number of consecutive pockets, and each pocket will, obviously, belong to exactly one box. At the same time, Alice does not change the order of the boxes, that is, the boxes are numbered in ascending order of the indices of the pockets in them.

After that, Alice and Jack will take turns alternately, with Alice going first.

At each turn, the current player will remove a positive number of peanuts from exactly one pocket which belongs to the leftmost non-empty box (i.e., the leftmost box containing at least one non-empty pocket). In other words, if we number the boxes from left to right, then each player can only pick peanuts from the pocket in the $$$j$$$-th box ($$$j \ge 2$$$) only if the $$$(j - 1)$$$-th box has no peanuts left. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

Alice is sure she will win since she has the advantage of dividing the pockets into boxes herself. Thus, she wanted to know how many ways there are for her to divide the peanuts into boxes at the start of the game so that she will win, assuming both players play optimally. Can you help her with the calculation?

As the result can be very large, output it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input and Output Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$) — the number of pockets.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of peanuts in each pocket.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of ways for Alice to divide the pockets into boxes at the start of the game to guarantee her win, assuming both players play optimally, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

398,"Problem: The two versions are different problems. In this version of the problem, you can choose the same integer twice or more. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

One day, Turtle was playing with $$$n$$$ sequences. Let the length of the $$$i$$$-th sequence be $$$l_i$$$. Then the $$$i$$$-th sequence was $$$a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \ldots, a_{i, l_i}$$$.

Piggy gave Turtle a problem to solve when Turtle was playing. The statement of the problem was:

- There was a non-negative integer $$$x$$$ at first. Turtle would perform an arbitrary number (possibly zero) of operations on the integer.
- In each operation, Turtle could choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le n$$$, and set $$$x$$$ to $$$\text{mex}^{\dagger}(x, a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \ldots, a_{i, l_i})$$$.
- Turtle was asked to find the answer, which was the maximum value of $$$x$$$ after performing an arbitrary number of operations.

Turtle solved the above problem without difficulty. He defined $$$f(k)$$$ as the answer to the above problem when the initial value of $$$x$$$ was $$$k$$$.

Then Piggy gave Turtle a non-negative integer $$$m$$$ and asked Turtle to find the value of $$$\sum\limits_{i = 0}^m f(i)$$$ (i.e., the value of $$$f(0) + f(1) + \ldots + f(m)$$$). Unfortunately, he couldn't solve this problem. Please help him!

406,"Problem: Kevin used to get into Rio's Memories, and in Rio's Memories, a series of contests was once held. Kevin remembers all the participants and all the contest problems from that time, but he has forgotten the specific rounds, the distribution of problems, and the exact rankings.

There are $$$ m $$$ problems in total, with the $$$ i $$$-th problem having a difficulty of $$$ b_i $$$. Let each contest consist of $$$ k $$$ problems, resulting in a total of $$$ \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor $$$ contests. This means that you select exactly $$$ \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor \cdot k $$$ problems for the contests in any combination you want, with each problem being selected at most once, and the remaining $$$m\bmod k$$$ problems are left unused. For example, if $$$m = 17$$$ and $$$k = 3$$$, you should create exactly $$$5$$$ contests consisting of $$$3$$$ problems each, and exactly $$$2$$$ problems will be left unused.

There are $$$ n $$$ participants in the contests, with Kevin being the $$$1$$$-st participant. The $$$ i $$$-th participant has a rating of $$$ a_i $$$. During the contests, each participant solves all problems with a difficulty not exceeding their rating, meaning the $$$ i $$$-th participant solves the $$$ j $$$-th problem if and only if $$$ a_i \geq b_j $$$. In each contest, Kevin's rank is one plus the number of participants who solve more problems than he does.

For each $$$ k = 1, 2, \ldots, m $$$, Kevin wants to know the minimum sum of his ranks across all $$$ \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor $$$ contests. In other words, for some value of $$$k$$$, after selecting the problems for each contest, you calculate the rank of Kevin in each contest and sum up these ranks over all $$$ \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor $$$ contests. Your goal is to minimize this value.

Note that contests for different values of $$$k$$$ are independent. It means that for different values of $$$k$$$, you can select the distribution of problems into the contests independently.

Input and Output Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$ t $$$ ($$$ 1 \le t \le 5\cdot 10^4 $$$).

The third line of each test case contains $$$ m $$$ integers $$$ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m $$$ ($$$ 0 \le b_i \le 10^9 $$$) — the difficulty of each problem.

It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$ n $$$ and the sum of $$$ m $$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$ 3 \cdot 10^5 $$$.

410,"Problem: Kevin is exploring problems related to binary strings in Chinatown. When he was at a loss, a stranger approached him and introduced a peculiar operation:

- Suppose the current binary string is $$$ t $$$, with a length of $$$ \vert t \vert $$$. Choose an integer $$$ 1 \leq p \leq \vert t \vert $$$. For all $$$ 1 \leq i < p $$$, simultaneously perform the operation $$$ t_i = \max(t_i, t_{i+1}) $$$, and then delete $$$ t_p $$$.

For example, suppose the current binary string is 01001, and you choose $$$ p = 4 $$$. Perform $$$ t_i = \max(t_i, t_{i+1}) $$$ for $$$t_1$$$, $$$t_2$$$, and $$$ t_3 $$$, transforming the string into 11001, then delete $$$ t_4 $$$, resulting in 1101.

Kevin finds this strange operation quite interesting. Thus, he wants to ask you: Given a binary string $$$ s $$$, how many distinct non-empty binary strings can you obtain through any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Since the answer may be very large, you only need to output the result modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

424,"Problem: Dora has just learned the programming language C++!

However, she has completely misunderstood the meaning of C++. She considers it as two kinds of adding operations on the array $$$c$$$ with $$$n$$$ elements. Dora has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. In one operation, she can choose one of the following things to do.

- Choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, and increase $$$c_i$$$ by $$$a$$$.
- Choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, and increase $$$c_i$$$ by $$$b$$$.

Note that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are constants, and they can be the same.

Let's define a range of array $$$d$$$ as $$$\max(d_i) - \min(d_i)$$$. For instance, the range of the array $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ is $$$4 - 1 = 3$$$, the range of the array $$$[5, 2, 8, 2, 2, 1]$$$ is $$$8 - 1 = 7$$$, and the range of the array $$$[3, 3, 3]$$$ is $$$3 - 3 = 0$$$.

429,"Problem: A conspiracy of ancient sages, who decided to redirect rivers for their own convenience, has put the world on the brink. But before implementing their grand plan, they decided to carefully think through their strategy — that's what sages do.

There are $$$n$$$ countries, each with exactly $$$k$$$ regions. For the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$i$$$-th country, they calculated the value $$$a_{i,j}$$$, which reflects the amount of water in it.

The sages intend to create channels between the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$i$$$-th country and the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$(i + 1)$$$-th country for all $$$1 \leq i \leq (n - 1)$$$ and for all $$$1 \leq j \leq k$$$.

Since all $$$n$$$ countries are on a large slope, water flows towards the country with the highest number. According to the sages' predictions, after the channel system is created, the new value of the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$i$$$-th country will be $$$b_{i,j} = a_{1,j} | a_{2,j} | ... | a_{i,j}$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise ""OR"" operation.

After the redistribution of water, the sages aim to choose the most suitable country for living, so they will send you $$$q$$$ queries for consideration.

Each query will contain $$$m$$$ requirements.

Each requirement contains three parameters: the region number $$$r$$$, the sign $$$o$$$ (either ""$$$<$$$"" or ""$$$>$$$""), and the value $$$c$$$. If $$$o$$$ = ""$$$<$$$"", then in the $$$r$$$-th region of the country you choose, the new value must be strictly less than the limit $$$c$$$, and if $$$o$$$ = ""$$$>$$$"", it must be strictly greater.

In other words, the chosen country $$$i$$$ must satisfy all $$$m$$$ requirements. If in the current requirement $$$o$$$ = ""$$$<$$$"", then it must hold that $$$b_{i,r} < c$$$, and if $$$o$$$ = ""$$$>$$$"", then $$$b_{i,r} > c$$$.

In response to each query, you should output a single integer — the number of the suitable country. If there are multiple such countries, output the smallest one. If no such country exists, output $$$-1$$$.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, k, q \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of countries, regions, and queries, respectively.

Next, there are $$$n$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \dots, a_{i,k}$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^9$$$), where $$$a_{i,j}$$$ is the value of the $$$j$$$-th region of the $$$i$$$-th country.

Then, $$$q$$$ queries are described.

The first line of each query contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of requirements.

Then follow $$$m$$$ lines, each containing an integer $$$r$$$, a character $$$o$$$, and an integer $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \leq r \leq k$$$, $$$0 \leq c \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$$$), where $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ are the region number and the value, and $$$o$$$ is either ""$$$<$$$"" or ""$$$>$$$"" — the sign.

It is guaranteed that $$$n \cdot k$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ and that the sum of $$$m$$$ across all queries also does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

Each book's type number is indicated on its spine. Moreover, each type of book is stored in the library in exactly two copies! And you have been appointed as the librarian.

One night, you wake up to a strange noise and see a creature leaving the building through a window. Three thick tomes of different colors were sticking out of the mysterious thief's backpack. Before you start searching for them, you decide to compute the numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ written on the spines of these books. All three numbers are distinct.

So, you have an unordered set of tomes, which includes one tome with each of the pairwise distinct numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, and two tomes for all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, except for $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$. You want to find these values $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$.

Since you are not working in a simple library, but in the Library of Magic, you can only use one spell in the form of a query to check the presence of books in their place:

- ""xor l r"" — Bitwise XOR query with parameters $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Let $$$k$$$ be the number of such tomes in the library whose numbers are greater than or equal to $$$l$$$ and less than or equal to $$$r$$$. You will receive the result of the computation $$$v_1 \oplus v_2 \oplus ... \oplus v_k$$$, where $$$v_1 ... v_k$$$ are the numbers on the spines of these tomes, and $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the operation of bitwise exclusive OR.

Since your magical abilities as a librarian are severely limited, you can make no more than $$$150$$$ queries.

Input and Output Format:
The first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 300$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$$$) — the number of types of tomes.

432,"Problem: You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$.

Two players are playing a game. The first player chooses an index $$$1 \le i \le n$$$. Then the second player chooses a different index $$$1 \le j \le n, i \neq j$$$. The first player wins if $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$ is not divisible by $$$k$$$. Otherwise, the second player wins.

We play as the first player. Determine whether it is possible to win, and if so, which index $$$i$$$ should be chosen.

444,"Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, it is guaranteed that $$$q \leq 10^5$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

An integer grid $$$A$$$ with $$$p$$$ rows and $$$q$$$ columns is called beautiful if:

- All elements of the grid are integers between $$$0$$$ and $$$2^{30}-1$$$, and
- For any subgrid, the XOR of the values at the corners is equal to $$$0$$$. Formally, for any four integers $$$i_1$$$, $$$i_2$$$, $$$j_1$$$, $$$j_2$$$ ($$$1 \le i_1 < i_2 \le p$$$; $$$1 \le j_1 < j_2 \le q$$$), $$$A_{i_1, j_1} \oplus A_{i_1, j_2} \oplus A_{i_2, j_1} \oplus A_{i_2, j_2} = 0$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

There is a partially filled integer grid $$$G$$$ with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns where only $$$k$$$ cells are filled. Polycarp wants to know how many ways he can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful.

However, Monocarp thinks that this problem is too easy. Therefore, he will perform $$$q$$$ updates on the grid. In each update, he will choose an unfilled cell and assign an integer to it. Note that these updates are persistent. That is, changes made to the grid will apply when processing future updates.

For each of the $$$q + 1$$$ states of the grid, the initial state and after each of the $$$q$$$ queries, determine the number of ways Polycarp can assign integers to the unfilled cells so that the grid is beautiful. Since this number can be very large, you are only required to output their values modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The following $$$k$$$ lines contain three integers $$$r$$$, $$$c$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le r \le n, 1 \le c \le m$$$; $$$0 \le v < 2^{30}$$$) indicating that $$$G_{r, c}$$$ is assigned the integer $$$v$$$.

459,"Problem: This is the hard version of the problem. The key difference between the two versions is highlighted in bold.

A group of $$$n$$$ spiders has come together to exchange plushies. Initially, each spider has $$$1$$$ plushie. Every year, if spider $$$i$$$ has at least one plushie, he will give exactly one plushie to spider $$$r_i$$$. Otherwise, he will do nothing. Note that all plushie transfers happen at the same time. In this version, each spider is allowed to have more than 1 plushie at any point in time.

The process is stable in the current year if each spider has the same number of plushies (before the current year's exchange) as he did the previous year (before the previous year's exchange). Note that year $$$1$$$ can never be stable.

Find the first year in which the process becomes stable.

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of spiders.

The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq r_i \leq n, r_i \neq i$$$) — the recipient of the plushie of each spider.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output an integer on a new line, the first year in which the process becomes stable.

460,"Problem: Swing is opening a pancake factory! A good pancake factory must be good at flattening things, so Swing is going to test his new equipment on 2D matrices.

Swing is given an $$$n \times n$$$ matrix $$$M$$$ containing positive integers. He has $$$q$$$ queries to ask you.

For each query, he gives you four integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, $$$y_2$$$ and asks you to flatten the submatrix bounded by $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ into an array $$$A$$$. Formally, $$$A = [M_{(x1,y1)}, M_{(x1,y1+1)}, \ldots, M_{(x1,y2)}, M_{(x1+1,y1)}, M_{(x1+1,y1+1)}, \ldots, M_{(x2,y2)}]$$$.

The following image depicts the flattening of a submatrix bounded by the red dotted lines. The orange arrows denote the direction that the elements of the submatrix are appended to the back of $$$A$$$, and $$$A$$$ is shown at the bottom of the image.

Afterwards, he asks you for the value of $$$\sum_{i=1}^{|A|} A_i \cdot i$$$ (sum of $$$A_i \cdot i$$$ over all $$$i$$$).

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2000, 1 \leq q \leq 10^6$$$) — the length of $$$M$$$ and the number of queries.

The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ integers each, the $$$i$$$'th of which contains $$$M_{(i,1)}, M_{(i,2)}, \ldots, M_{(i,n)}$$$ ($$$1 \leq M_{(i, j)} \leq 10^6$$$).

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain four integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, and $$$y_2$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq n, 1 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq n$$$) — the bounds of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

For each test case, output the results of the $$$q$$$ queries on a new line.

463,"Problem: There is a shop that sells action figures near Monocarp's house. A new set of action figures will be released shortly; this set contains $$$n$$$ figures, the $$$i$$$-th figure costs $$$i$$$ coins and is available for purchase from day $$$i$$$ to day $$$n$$$.

For each of the $$$n$$$ days, Monocarp knows whether he can visit the shop.

Every time Monocarp visits the shop, he can buy any number of action figures which are sold in the shop (of course, he cannot buy an action figure that is not yet available for purchase). If Monocarp buys at least two figures during the same day, he gets a discount equal to the cost of the most expensive figure he buys (in other words, he gets the most expensive of the figures he buys for free).

Monocarp wants to buy exactly one $$$1$$$-st figure, one $$$2$$$-nd figure, ..., one $$$n$$$-th figure from the set. He cannot buy the same figure twice. What is the minimum amount of money he has to spend?

Input and Output Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

- the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 4 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of figures in the set (and the number of days);
- the second line contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$|s| = n$$$, each $$$s_i$$$ is either 0 or 1). If Monocarp can visit the shop on the $$$i$$$-th day, then $$$s_i$$$ is 1; otherwise, $$$s_i$$$ is 0.

Additional constraints on the input:

- in each test case, $$$s_n$$$ is 1, so Monocarp is always able to buy all figures during the $$$n$$$-th day;
- the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum amount of money Monocarp has to spend.
