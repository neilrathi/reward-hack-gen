Initially, the $$$i$$$-th barrel has $$$v_i$$$ units of water.\\n\\nAdjacent barrels are connected by pipes. In other words, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, barrels $$$i$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$ are connected by a single horizontal pipe at height $$$h_i$$$. The widths of the pipes are negligible. These pipes allow water to flow between barrels.\\n\\nNow you want to play with barrels. Your plan is to maximize the volume of the water in the first barrel by throwing clay into barrels. In one step, you can choose any barrel and throw one unit of clay into it. One unit of clay has the same volume as one unit of water. Clay is heavier than water and doesn't mix with it, so it falls to the bottom of the barrel, distributing evenly.\\n\\nClay has a sticky structure, so it seals pipes if the clay column is high enough. More formally, suppose the pipe is at height $$$h$$$. If the height of the clay column is also $$$\\\\boldsymbol{h}$$$ (or lower), the pipe is working. But the moment you add more clay into the barrel, the pipe becomes sealed instantly, preventing any water from moving between barrels.\\n\\nYou have a mountain of clay, so you can repeat the step described above any number of times. However, between the steps, you have to wait until the water reaches the new equilibrium.\\n\\nWhat is the maximum water volume you can collect in the first barrel?\\n\\nAssume that the barrels are high enough, so the water doesn't overflow, and the pipe widths are negligible.\\n\\nTest Case Format:\\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of barrels.\\n\\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \\\\dots, v_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le v_i \\\\le 10^6$$$), where $$$v_i$$$ is the initial water volume in the $$$i$$$-th barrel.\\n\\nThe third line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\\\dots, h_{n - 1}$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le h_i \\\\le 10^6$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the height of the pipe between the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$(i + 1)$$$-st barrel.\\n\\nAdditional constraint on the input: the given water heights are in an equilibrium.\\n\\nPrint a single number\u00a0\u2014 the maximum volume of water in the first barrel.

The bonus will be paid to the entire team only if the project is completed; in other words, if the total amount of voluntary work units on the project is greater than or equal to $$$k$$$.\\n\\nThe amount of work that can be performed by each engineer is not limited. However, all engineers value their labour. The $$$i$$$-th engineer estimates one unit of their work as $$$b_i$$$ burles. If the bonus is paid, the benefit $$$s_i$$$ of the $$$i$$$-th engineer for completing $$$c$$$ units of work is defined as $$$s_i = a_i - c \\\\cdot b_i$$$. If the bonus is not paid, the engineer will not volunteer to do any work.\\n\\nEngineers work together for many years, so they know how the bonus is going to be distributed and how much their colleagues value the labour. That is, all $$$a_i$$$ and all $$$b_i$$$ are known to every engineer in the team.\\n\\nEngineers are eager to get the bonus, so they agreed on the following process of work distribution between them:\\n\\n- the first engineer says: \\\"I will complete $$$c_1$$$ units of work\\\", where $$$c_1$$$ is a non-negative integer;\\n- then, the second engineer says: \\\"I will complete $$$c_2$$$ units of work\\\", where $$$c_2$$$ is a non-negative integer;\\n- ... and so on;\\n- finally, the $$$n$$$-th engineer says: \\\"I will complete $$$c_n$$$ units of work\\\", where $$$c_n$$$ is a non-negative integer.\\n\\nEvery engineer voices $$$c_i$$$ in a way to maximize their own benefit $$$s_i$$$. If the expected benefit is going to be zero, an engineer will still agree to work to get the experience and to help their colleagues obtain the bonus. However, if the benefit is expected to be negative for some reason (an engineer needs to perform an excessive amount of work or the project is not going to be completed), that engineer will not work at all (completes zero amount of work units).\\n\\nGiven that every engineer acts perfectly, your task is to find out the numbers $$$c_i$$$ voiced by every engineer.\\n\\nTest Case Format:\\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$; $$$1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^6$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of engineers in the company and the number of work units the project requires, respectively.\\n\\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the bonus which will be paid to the $$$i$$$-th engineer if the project is completed.\\n\\nThe third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 1000$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ is the work unit cost for the $$$i$$$-th engineer.\\n\\nPrint $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \\\\le c_i \\\\le k$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the amount of work completed by each engineer given that every engineer behaves optimally.
