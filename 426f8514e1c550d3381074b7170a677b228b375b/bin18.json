The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ are smaller. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\\n\\nNow Little John is rich, and so he finally buys a house big enough to fit himself and his favorite bracket sequence. But somehow, he ended up with a lot of brackets! Frustrated, he penetrates through the ceiling with the \\\"buddha palm\\\".\\n\\nA bracket sequence is called balanced if it can be constructed by the following formal grammar.\\n\\n1. The empty sequence $$$\\\\varnothing$$$ is balanced.\\n2. If the bracket sequence $$$A$$$ is balanced, then $$$\\\\mathtt{(}A\\\\mathtt{)}$$$ is also balanced.\\n3. If the bracket sequences $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are balanced, then the concatenated sequence $$$A B$$$ is also balanced.\\n\\nFor example, the sequences \\\"(())()\\\", \\\"()\\\", \\\"(()(()))\\\", and the empty sequence are balanced, while \\\"(()\\\" and \\\"(()))(\\\" are not.\\n\\nGiven a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$, a pair of indices $$$(i,j)$$$ ($$$i<j$$$) is called a good pair if $$$s_i$$$ is '(', $$$s_j$$$ is ')', and the two brackets are added simultaneously with respect to Rule 2 while constructing the sequence $$$s$$$. For example, the sequence \\\"(())()\\\" has three different good pairs, which are $$$(1,4)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, and $$$(5,6)$$$. One can show that any balanced bracket sequence of $$$2n$$$ brackets contains exactly $$$n$$$ different good pairs, and using any order of rules to construct the same bracket sequence will yield the same set of good pairs.\\n\\nEmily will play a bracket guessing game with John. The game is played as follows.\\n\\nInitially, John has a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ containing $$$n$$$ different good pairs, which is not known to Emily. John tells Emily the value of $$$n$$$ and asks Emily to guess the sequence.\\n\\nThroughout $$$n$$$ turns, John gives Emily the following kind of clue on each turn.\\n\\n- $$$l\\\\;r$$$: The sequence $$$s$$$ contains a good pair $$$(l,r)$$$.\\n\\nThe clues that John gives Emily are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.\\n\\nAt a certain point, Emily can be certain that the balanced bracket sequence satisfying the clues given so far is unique. For example, assume Emily knows that $$$s$$$ has $$$3$$$ good pairs, and it contains the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Out of $$$5$$$ balanced bracket sequences with $$$3$$$ good pairs, there exists only one such sequence \\\"((()))\\\" with the good pair $$$(2,5)$$$. Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need $$$n$$$ turns to guess $$$s$$$.\\n\\nTo find out the content of $$$s$$$ as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn. As the answers may be huge, you need to find them modulo $$$998\\\\,244\\\\,353$$$.\\n\\nTest Case Format:\\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Return only the code and nothing else.\\n\\nuser: Problem: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the two versions is the definition of deterministic max-heap, time limit, and constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\\n\\nConsider a perfect binary tree with size $$$2^n - 1$$$, with nodes numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n-1$$$ and rooted at $$$1$$$. For each vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v \\\\le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), vertex $$$2v$$$ is its left child and vertex $$$2v + 1$$$ is its right child. Each node $$$v$$$ also has a value $$$a_v$$$ assigned to it.\\n\\nDefine the operation $$$\\\\mathrm{pop}$$$ as follows:\\n\\n1. initialize variable $$$v$$$ as $$$1$$$;\\n2. repeat the following process until vertex $$$v$$$ is a leaf (i.e. until $$$2^{n - 1} \\\\le v \\\\le 2^n - 1$$$);   among the children of $$$v$$$, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as $$$x$$$; if the values on them are equal (i.e. $$$a_{2v} = a_{2v + 1}$$$), you can choose any of them;  assign $$$a_x$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := a_x$$$);  assign $$$x$$$ to $$$v$$$ (i.e. $$$v := x$$$);\\n3. assign $$$-1$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := -1$$$).\\n\\nThen we say the $$$\\\\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, $$$a_{2v} \\\\neq a_{2v + 1}$$$ would hold whenever choosing between them.\\n\\nA binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v \\\\le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), both $$$a_v \\\\ge a_{2v}$$$ and $$$a_v \\\\ge a_{2v + 1}$$$ hold.\\n\\nA max-heap is deterministic if the $$$\\\\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first time.\\n\\nInitially, $$$a_v := 0$$$ for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v \\\\le 2^n - 1$$$), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation $$$\\\\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times:\\n\\n- Choose an integer $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v \\\\le 2^n - 1$$$) and, for every vertex $$$x$$$ on the path between $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$, add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_x$$$.\\n\\nTwo heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.\\n\\nSince the answer might be large, print it modulo $$$p$$$.\\n\\nTest Case Format:\\nEach test contains multiple test cases.
