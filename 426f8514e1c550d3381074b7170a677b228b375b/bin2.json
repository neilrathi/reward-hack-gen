The difference between the two versions is the definition of deterministic max-heap, time limit, and constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\\n\\nConsider a perfect binary tree with size $$$2^n - 1$$$, with nodes numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n-1$$$ and rooted at $$$1$$$. For each vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v \\\\le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), vertex $$$2v$$$ is its left child and vertex $$$2v + 1$$$ is its right child. Each node $$$v$$$ also has a value $$$a_v$$$ assigned to it.\\n\\nDefine the operation $$$\\\\mathrm{pop}$$$ as follows:\\n\\n1. initialize variable $$$v$$$ as $$$1$$$;\\n2. repeat the following process until vertex $$$v$$$ is a leaf (i.e. until $$$2^{n - 1} \\\\le v \\\\le 2^n - 1$$$);   among the children of $$$v$$$, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as $$$x$$$; if the values on them are equal (i.e. $$$a_{2v} = a_{2v + 1}$$$), you can choose any of them;  assign $$$a_x$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := a_x$$$);  assign $$$x$$$ to $$$v$$$ (i.e. $$$v := x$$$);\\n3. assign $$$-1$$$ to $$$a_v$$$ (i.e. $$$a_v := -1$$$).\\n\\nThen we say the $$$\\\\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, $$$a_{2v} \\\\neq a_{2v + 1}$$$ would hold whenever choosing between them.\\n\\nA binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v \\\\le 2^{n - 1} - 1$$$), both $$$a_v \\\\ge a_{2v}$$$ and $$$a_v \\\\ge a_{2v + 1}$$$ hold.\\n\\nA max-heap is deterministic if the $$$\\\\mathrm{pop}$$$ operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first and the second time.\\n\\nInitially, $$$a_v := 0$$$ for every vertex $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v \\\\le 2^n - 1$$$), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation $$$\\\\mathrm{add}$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times:\\n\\n- Choose an integer $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le v \\\\le 2^n - 1$$$) and, for every vertex $$$x$$$ on the path between $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$, add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_x$$$.\\n\\nTwo heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.\\n\\nSince the answer might be large, print it modulo $$$p$$$.\\n\\nTest Case Format:\\nEach test contains multiple test cases.
