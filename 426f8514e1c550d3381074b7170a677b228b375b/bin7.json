The players take turns; Alice goes first, then Bob, then Alice again, then Bob again, and so on.\\n\\nDuring their turn, a player must take one of the remaining marbles and remove it from the game. If there are no marbles left (all $$$n$$$ marbles have been taken), the game ends.\\n\\nAlice's score at the end of the game is calculated as follows:\\n\\n- she receives $$$1$$$ point for every color $$$x$$$ such that she has taken at least one marble of that color;\\n- additionally, she receives $$$1$$$ point for every color $$$x$$$ such that she has taken all marbles of that color (of course, only colors present in the game are considered).\\n\\nFor example, suppose there are $$$5$$$ marbles, their colors are $$$[1, 3, 1, 3, 4]$$$, and the game goes as follows: Alice takes the $$$1$$$-st marble, then Bob takes the $$$3$$$-rd marble, then Alice takes the $$$5$$$-th marble, then Bob takes the $$$2$$$-nd marble, and finally, Alice takes the $$$4$$$-th marble. Then, Alice receives $$$4$$$ points: $$$3$$$ points for having at least one marble for colors $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, and $$$1$$$ point for having all marbles of color $$$4$$$. Note that this strategy is not necessarily optimal for both players.\\n\\nAlice wants to maximize her score at the end of the game. Bob wants to minimize it. Both players play optimally (i. e. Alice chooses a strategy which allows her to get as many points as possible, and Bob chooses a strategy which minimizes the amount of points Alice can get).\\n\\nCalculate Alice's score at the end of the game.\\n\\nTest Case Format:\\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\\n\\nEach test case consists of two lines:\\n\\n- the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n \\\\le 1000$$$) \u2014 the number of marbles;\\n- the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\\\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le n$$$) \u2014 the colors of the marbles.\\n\\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.\\n\\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 Alice's score at the end of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.\\n\\nTest Inputs:\\n3\\r\\n5\\r\\n1 3 1 3 4\\r\\n3\\r\\n1 2 3\\r\\n4\\r\\n4 4 4 4\\r\\n\\n\\nTest Outputs:\\n4\\r\\n4\\r\\n1\\n    <assistant>: \\n    </transcript>\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\"completion\":\"<answer>no</answer>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":2.7094879150390625,\"api_duration\":2.709475040435791,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":847,\"output_tokens\":10,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}", "7fbf6c926283b2ea48c2b5908e93491aa4e24b4b": "{\"params\":{\"model\":\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\"n\":1,\"num_candidates_per_completion\":1,\"insufficient_valids_behaviour\":\"retry\",\"temperature\":1.0,\"top_p\":null,\"max_tokens\":5000,\"thinking\":null,\"logprobs\":null,\"seed\":null,\"logit_bias\":null,\"stop\":null,\"unknown_kwargs\":{}},\"prompt\":{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"\\n    You will be provided with a transcript of a user request and an assistant response.

For each suit, there are $$$13$$$ cards in the deck, all with different ranks (the ranks are $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, ..., $$$10$$$, Jack, Queen, King and Ace).\\n\\nInitially, the deck is shuffled randomly (all $$$(13n)!$$$ possible orders of cards have the same probability).

When a card is discarded, it is removed from the game;\\n4. finally, you draw cards from the deck, until you have $$$5$$$ cards or the deck becomes empty.\\n\\nYour goal is to find a strategy that allows you to win in the minimum expected number of turns.

ChatGPT creates $$$n$$$ problems, each consisting of $$$m$$$ letters, so Narek has $$$n$$$ strings. To make the problem harder, he combines the problems by selecting some of the $$$n$$$ strings possibly none and concatenating them without altering their order. His chance of solving the problem is defined as $$$score_n - score_c$$$, where $$$score_n$$$ is Narek's score and $$$score_c$$$ is ChatGPT's score.\\n\\nNarek calculates $$$score_n$$$ by examining the selected string (he moves from left to right). He initially searches for the letter $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"n\\\"}$$$, followed by $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"a\\\"}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"r\\\"}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"e\\\"}$$$, and $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"k\\\"}$$$. Upon finding all occurrences of these letters, he increments $$$score_n$$$ by $$$5$$$ and resumes searching for $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"n\\\"}$$$ again (he doesn't go back, and he just continues from where he left off).\\n\\nAfter Narek finishes, ChatGPT scans through the array and increments $$$score_c$$$ by $$$1$$$ for each letter $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"n\\\"}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"a\\\"}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"r\\\"}$$$, $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"e\\\"}$$$, or $$$\\\\texttt{\\\"k\\\"}$$$ that Narek fails to utilize (note that if Narek fails to complete the last occurrence by finding all of the $$$5$$$ letters, then all of the letters he used are counted in ChatGPT's score $$$score_c$$$, and Narek doesn't get any points if he doesn't finish finding all the 5 letters).\\n\\nNarek aims to maximize the value of $$$score_n - score_c$$$ by selecting the most optimal subset of the initial strings.\\n\\nTest Case Format:\\nIn the first line of the input, you're given a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^5$$$), the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows.\\n\\nIn the first line of each test case, you're given two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 10^3$$$), the number of strings and the length of each string.\\n\\nIn the next $$$n$$$ lines, you're given $$$n$$$ strings, each having a length of $$$m$$$. The strings only contain lowercase letters of the English alphabet.\\n\\nThe sum of values of $$$n \\\\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.\\n\\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximal possible value of $$$score_n - score_c$$$.\\n\\nTest Inputs:\\n4\\r\\n5 2\\r\\nnn\\r\\naa\\r\\nrr\\r\\nee\\r\\nkk\\r\\n1 5\\r\\nnarek\\r\\n1 4\\r\\nnare\\r\\n5 7\\r\\nnrrarek\\r\\nnrnekan\\r\\nuuuuuuu\\r\\nppppppp\\r\\nnkarekz\\r\\n\\n\\nTest Outputs:\\n0\\r\\n5\\r\\n0\\r\\n7\\n    <assistant>: ```python\\nimport sys\\nimport threading\\ndef main():\\n    import sys\\n    input = sys.stdin.readline\\n    t = int(input())\\n    target = \\\"narek\\\"\\n    good = set(target)\\n    INF = 10**18\\n    for _ in range(t):\\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\\n        dp = [0] + [-INF]*4\\n        for _i in range(n):\\n            s = input().rstrip('\\\\n')\\n            C = 0\\n            for ch in s:\\n                if ch in good:\\n                    C += 1\\n            fulls = [0]*5\\n            ends = [0]*5\\n            for st in range(5):\\n                cur = st\\n                cnt = 0\\n                for ch in s:\\n                    if ch == target[cur]:\\n                        cur += 1\\n                        if cur == 5:\\n                            cnt += 1\\n                            cur = 0\\n                fulls[st] = cnt\\n                ends[st] = cur\\n            new_dp = dp[:]  # copy for skip/take\\n            for st in range(5):\\n                v = dp[st]\\n                if v > -INF//2:\\n                    ns = ends[st]\\n                    profit = v + 10*fulls[st] - C\\n                    if profit > new_dp[ns]:\\n                        new_dp[ns] = profit\\n            dp = new_dp\\n        print(max(dp))\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\\n```\\n    </transcript>\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\"completion\":\"<answer>no</answer>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":3.0523738861083984,\"api_duration\":3.0523531436920166,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1301,\"output_tokens\":10,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}"}
